        <p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#C0C0C0">In 1885 it was decided
        that a new and better school house should be built.&nbsp; In the fall a
        two story building of red brick was constructed.&nbsp; There were two
        rooms upstairs and two rooms down stairs and four teachers always at
        work.&nbsp; It had gone through many changes and improvements and was
        very dear to many people.&nbsp; In about the year 1910 it was voted by
        the citizens to build a high school in the community.&nbsp; The sight
        for the new building was thought to be best just east of the Grade
        School building.&nbsp; The building was a beautiful structure made of
        brick, the lower part of the building being pebble dashed.&nbsp; It was
        heated by oil, lighted by electricity, had a fine ventilating system,
        domestic science, and manual training rooms, a large auditorium, and
        four recreation rooms.&nbsp; The average enrollment of the High school
        was about forty-five.&nbsp; The first class to graduate from Rossville
        High School was composed of one member but the following year and each
        of these succeeding years there was an average of twelve or fourteen
        students.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#C0C0C0">In 1940
        Rossville new district #34 Grade School was dedicated.&nbsp; It was
        built at a cost of approximately of $42,000 and contained four class
        rooms, one combination classroom, library, an auditorium, kitchen,
        bathrooms, and a boiler room.&nbsp; Further additions were made to the
        school in 1952,1963, 1978, and 1989.</font></b><p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#C0C0C0">The

        schools of Rossville, St. Marys, Emmett, and Delia were combined.&nbsp; The district operates
        two High Schools and four Grade Schools.&nbsp; As of 2001, the District population
        is approximately seven thousand students.&nbsp; The district is
        governed by a seven member school board with two members each from St.
        Marys and Rossville, and one member each from Emmett and Delia.&nbsp;
