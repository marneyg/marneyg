          Schools<br>
          as told by Mrs. Irene Howard
          Flanagan (Class of 1917) in 1922.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;During the years 1865-68 the country
        around Rossville was not very thickly populated. There not being enough
        to make a new district school successful, a number of the citizens of
        Rossville formed a little association and built a small one story frame
        building on the corner of North Main and Marion streets. A teacher was
        hired, and most of the children in town attended that private
        school.&quot;</font></b></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4" face="Arial"><b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;By the year 1870 the country was
        in a very prosperous state and was much more thickly settled than it had
        been four or five years previous. So it was at this time that District
        34 was formed and a two room frame building was built on the corner of
        Navarre and Marion streets. This was the first public school that was
        ever known in Rossville. As the school attendance was steadily
        increasing, a few years later, a large two story frame building, now
        known as the Rossville Hotel, was built on the same location as this
        former school had stood. Mr. Higginbotham bought the old building, moved
        it away and used it as part of his house.&quot;</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4" face="Arial"><b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;School in this new building was a
        perfect success and prospered wonderfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 1884,
        it was decided that a new and better school house should be built.&nbsp;&nbsp;So
        in the fall of 1885, a new two story building of red brick, which is
        still standing and is being used at the present time for the Grade
        School, was ready for use.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was greatly appreciated by all
        those who had a part in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The building has undergone many
        changes and improvements and today it is a place dear to many people
        because it is there they received all the education they have.&nbsp;&nbsp;There
        being two rooms upstairs and two rooms downstairs, four teachers have
        always been employed.&quot;</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4" face="Arial"><b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In about the year 1910 it was
        voted by the citizens of Rossville to build a High School building in
        this community under the Barnes law.&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the High School
        was completed the High School students were instructed in the fourth
        room and library of the grade school building.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to do
        this, the first room children were moved down into the old Baptist
        church.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two upper rooms were then moved:&nbsp;&nbsp;the
        fourth room pupils occupying the third room and the third room pupils
        occupying the second room and so on down.&quot;</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4" face="Arial"><b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The site for the new building was
        thought to be the best just east of the grade school building, so work
        was started immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;The building is a beautiful
        structure made of buff colored brick, the lower part of the building
        being pebble dashed.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heated by oil, lighted with
        electricity, has a fine ventilating system, domestic science and manual
        training rooms, a large auditorium, and four recitation rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;It
        was thought the building would be ready for use by the fall of 1912, but
        every one especially the students who were ready to enter High School
        was sadly disappointed.&nbsp;&nbsp;On account of the weather and other hindrances,
        the contractors had not completed the work.&nbsp;&nbsp;High school was
        held in the Fritz Opera House for the first part of the year, but at the
        beginning of the second semester the students entered the new building.&nbsp;&nbsp;Four
        teachers were employed up until the years 1915-16 when, in order to
        lessen expenses, and there not being a very large enrollment, three
        teachers were hired.&nbsp;&nbsp;This year 1916-17 also there are only
        three teachers employed in the High School.&quot;</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4" face="Arial"><b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average enrollment of the High
        school is about forty-five.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first class to graduate from
        Rossville high school was composed of one member but the following year
        and each succeeding year, there has been on an average, a class of about
        twelve or fourteen.&nbsp;&nbsp;this High school is on the accredited
        list of High schools and a diploma will admit you to any higher
        institution.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4" face="Arial"><b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In athletics, the school has always
        taken a prominent part.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have taken all the honors and
        prizes at the County Track Meet every year they have entered, excepting
        the first year when they were not so experienced as now.&nbsp;&nbsp;So
        we should all extend our heartiest wishes for the success of Rossville
        High school and hope that nothing will impede her progress.<br>
