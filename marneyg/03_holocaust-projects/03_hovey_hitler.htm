  <p class=MsoNormal>Although Hitler grew up in Austria he always felt that he
  was German, so he moved to Munich when he obtained enough money. At the
  outbreak of World War I he enlisted in the Bavarian army and soon earned the
  iron cross first class for bravery. During this time he was twice in the
  hospital, once for shellshock and once for gas blindness (temporary). After
  the Treaty of Versailles was signed a man named Adolf Gemlich wrote a letter
  to Hitler’s branch asking why Germany lost the war. Hitler was ordered to respond.
  This reply is known to be his first anti-Semitic (anti-Jewish) writing.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>“Dear Herr Gemlich,</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>The danger posed by Jewry for our people today finds
  expression in undeniable aversion of wide sections of our people. The cause
  of this aversion is not to be found in clear recognition of the consciously
  or unconsciously systematic and pernicious effect of the Jews as a totality
  upon our nation. Rather, it arises mostly from personal contact and from the
  personal impression which the individual Jew leaves almost always an
  unfavorable one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span>For this reason,
  anti-Semitism is too easily characterized as a mere emotional phenomenon. And
  yet this is not incorrect. Anti-Semitism as a political movement may not and
  cannot be defined by emotional impulses, but by recognition of the facts. The
  facts are these: First, Jewry is absolutely a race and not a religious
  association. Evan the Jews never designate themselves as Jewish Germans,
  Jewish Poles, or Jewish Americans but always as German, Polish, or American Jews.
  Jews have never yet adopted much more than the Language of the foreign
  nations among whom they live. A German who is forced to make use of the
  French language in France, Italian in Italy, Chinese in China does not
  thereby become a Frenchman, Italian, or Chinaman. It’s the same with the Jew
  who lives among us and is forced to make use of the German language. He des
  not thereby become a German. Neither does the Mosaic faith, so important for
  the survival of this race whose members belong exclusively to just one
  definite religion.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>Through thousands of years of the closest kind of
  inbreeding, Jews in general have maintained their race and their
  peculiarities far more distinctly than many of the peoples among whom they
  have lived. And thus comes the fact that there lives amongst us a non German,
  alien race which neither wishes nor is able to sacrifice its racial character
  of to deny its feeling, thinking, and striving. Nevertheless, it possesses
  all the political rights we do. If the ethos of the Jews is revealed in the
  purely material possessions we prize most highly on earth.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>This thinking and striving after money and power, and the feelings

  the choice of methods and pitiless in their employment. In autocratically
  ruled states he whines for the favor of the “His Majesty” and misuses it like
  a leech fastened upon the nations. In democracies he vies for the favor of
  the masses, cringes before the “majesty of the people,” and recognizes only
  the majesty of money.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>He destroys the character of prices with Byzantine
  flattery, national pride (the strength of a people), with ridicule and
  shameless breeding to depravity. His method of battle is that public opinion

  falsified by it. His power is the power of money, which multiplies in his hands
  effortlessly and endlessly through interest, and which forces peoples under
  the most dangerous of yolks. Its golden glitter, so attractive in the
  beginning, conceals the ultimately tragic consequences. Everything men strive
  after as a higher goal, be it religion, socialism, democracy, is to the Jew
  only means to an end, the way to satisfy his lust for gold and domination. </p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>That is but a sample of the lunacy spread by Hitler and
  his followers. This writing lead to the crimes of Hitler’s rule in Germany
  caused, if you see it the same way I do you may know that it is only the
  satanic beginning to the darkest racism. In 1942 Joseph Goebbles said “Jewry
  must pay for its crime just as our Fuehrer (leader) prophesied in Reichstag:
  namely by the wiping out of the Jewish race in Europe and possibly the entire
  World.” This is a false prophecy you may thank God for that.<span

  <p class=MsoNormal>This is what this man preached to anyone who would listen.
  With these views anyone reading this (that means you) can see that Hitler was
  insane, even as he was losing the war he would not stop until Germany was
  crushed. Hitler was not what he promised he wrought destruction on Germany
  and many other nations. This ended on April 30,1945 when he committed suicide
  rather than be captured alive.</p>
