  <p class=MsoNormal>The most medical of all the modes of killing was to get a
  phenol injection. Which was used in the early stages of Auschwitz. First it
  was injected into the vein, then directly into the heart. This procedure took
  place in 20. Two Jewish prisoners brought a victim in. The right arm was over
  the eyes. The left was extended out horizontally. This was so that they could
  see what was happening and so that the chest was unguarded. The average
  amount of time it took to die was two minutes twenty two seconds.</p>

  commercial use as a pest-killing agent. The nazis used as a people killer. After
