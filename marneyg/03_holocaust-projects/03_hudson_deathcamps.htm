  <p class=MsoNormal>When concentration camps did open at first they weren’t
  big at all. At first Auschwitz had to test gasses. After that, an order was
  given to send Jews there. The Fascist partners forced people to build local
  concentration camps. Many camps in Europe were labor camps. Later on slave
  labors had to build death camps. Gas cambers and crematories were designed at
  Chelmno, Auschwitz, and Treblinka to kill ten million people fast and dispose

  monoxide. After words, they were dead they burned the bodies, and told the
  parents that they had to burn them to stop diseases from spreading. Some
