  dissidents, common criminals, Gypsy men, homosexuals, asocial and others who
  were considered “enemies of the state,” Dachau was the place where many top

  Hitler was taken in as Chancellor of Germany. The Nazis blamed the Communists
  of the arson fire, but the Communists claimed that the Nazis had set the fire
  themselves in order to begin a reign of terror. After President Paul von
  Hindeburg used his emergency powers under Article 48 of the German
  Constitution to hold off all evil rights, the leading Communists were
  imprisoned with no formal changes being brought against them. The first
  prisoners brought to the old gunpowder factory were 200 Communists, including
  some of the members of the Reichstag, who had been taken into “protective
  custody.” Heinrich Himmler, who had been nominated the Munich Chief of
  police, announced the opening of the camp in a news conference on March 20,

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Tahoma;color:purple'>In April 1942
  a new brick building called Baracke X was planned for the Dachau camp. It was
  designed to house a homicidal gas chamber, disguised as a shower room, and
  four cremation ovens. Construction began in July 1942, using the labor of the
  only prisoners not forced to work in the factories at Dachau. The building
  was finished in 1943 but a sign in the gas chamber said today inexplicably
  informs tourists that this room was never used for gassing people. Instead,
  the Dachau museum says that 3,16 “terminally ill” prisoners were transported
  from Dachau all the way to Hartheim castle near Linz, Austria where they were
  murdered in a gas chamber there. A letter from Dr. Sigmund Rascher to
  Heinrich Himmler, head of the concentration camps, which makes a reference to
  a facility like one at Hartheim which the Nazis were planning to build at
  Dachau, is the best proof that the fake shower room in the crematory building
  was actually a gas chamber. The new Baracke X also contains four
  disinfections gas chambers designed to kill lice in clothing with the use of
  Zyklon B, the disinfections gas chambers designed to kill the Jews in the gas
  chambers at Majdanek and Auschwitz in Poland. The clothing was disinfected in
  all the camps in an attempt to prevent typhus, which is spread by lice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  Wicker surrendered the Dachau concentration camp to Brigadier General Henning
  Linden of the 42<sup>nd</sup> Rainbow Division under a white flag of truce.
  The 45<sup>th</sup> Thunderbird Infantry Division also participated in the
  liberation of Dachau, arriving at the southeast entrance into the nearby SS
  main entrance where Wicker was waiting to surrender.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Tahoma;color:purple'>Before
  reaching the concentration camp, the 45<sup>th</sup> Thunderbird Division had
  discovered an abandoned train, which no engine, on a branch railroad line,
  which at the time ran from Dachau station along Freisinger street in the
  direction of the camp. Inside the 39 train cars were the corpses of 2,310
  prisoners who had been evacuated from Buchenwald on April 7, 1945 and,
  because of heavy bombing and starfing by Allied planes in the last days
  before the American soldiers arrived. Most of the SS guards had left the camp
  the next day and there was no one left to remove the bodies and burn them.
  The train had started out with 4,500 to 5,000 prisoners on board about 1,300
  made it to Dachau still alive. Some of the dead had been buried along the
  way, or left in rows alongside the tracks. The gruesome sight of the death
  train, with some of the corpses riddled by bullets, so affected the young
  soldiers of the 45<sup>th</sup> Thunderbird Division that they lined up
  German Waffen-SS soldiers stationed at the garrison, who had just
  surrendered, and executed them with their hands on the air. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  American soldiers and were allowed to shoot of beat to death some of the
  German guards while liberators looked on. The bodies of the dead German

  entering the camp after the surrender, the American liberators, and the news
  reporters with them, were horrified to discover over 900 sick and dying
  prisoners in the infirmary barracks. According to the court testimony of the
  camp doctor, as many as 400 prisoners were dying of disease each day in the
  final days before the liberation. Most of the regular guards had escaped
  leaving behind the unburied naked bodies of those who had died in the last
  days before the liberation. Accompanied by Communist political prisoners, who
  served as guards, the Americans toured the prison camp and were shown the
  building just outside the barbed wire enclosure, which the gas chamber
  disguised, as a shower room. The Americans heard eye-witness of prisoners who
  had been gassed to death in this chamber and stories of there prisoners being
  shoved into the crematory ovens while still alive. Bodies of fully clothed
  dead inmates were found piled inside the new crematorium building and many
  more naked corpses were piled up outside. Outside the disinfections chambers,
  there was a huge pile of clothing waiting to be fumigated with Zyklon B gas
  pellets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">      </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
