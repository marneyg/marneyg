    1945, but had only been known by their camp assigned numbers. Archivists at

    The Buchenwald Concentration Camp was liberated on April 11, 1945 by 
    soldiers in the Sixth Armored Division of the U.S. Third Army, commanded by 
    General Gorge S. Patton. Before the soldiers arrived the camp had already 
    been taken over by the German Communist prisoners, who had killed some of 
    the guards and forced the rest to escape to the nearby woods. There was 
    approximately 21,000 prisoners at Buchenwald on the day of liberation.</font></td>
