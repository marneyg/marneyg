        <td width="50%">&nbsp;&nbsp; Many horrible things happened on 
        Kristallnacht. Just a few are stated here. People that did the damage 
        came in groups of five or six. They walked the streets breaking windows 
        and raiding Jewish-owned shops. Some Jews were attacked on the streets, 
        in their homes, at work, and in their places of worship. Many people 
        were awakened by the sound of broken glass. Germans that were not part 
        of the attacks just stood by and watched. Jews were forced to watch as 
        their homes and businesses burned. Many Jews were so distressed that 
        they committed suicide.
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some other things that happened were even worse. In F<font face="Times New Roman">ürth</font>, 
        Germany, Jews were taken into a dark theatre and forced to watch as 
        their friends and family were beaten onstage. A young boy from Leipzig, 
        Germany got THROWN from a third-story window. He broke both of his legs 
        because of the fall. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Somebody once said &quot;Every single Jew was beaten, chased, 
        robbed, insulted, and humiliated. The SA tore Jews from their beds, 
        mercilessly beat them in their apartments and then... chased them half 
        to death... Blood flowed everywhere.&quot; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Many synagogues burned down on November 9th, 1938. One 
        way they did this was by going inside, putting gasoline on the holy arks 
        and seats, and then setting them on fire.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
