    S.S. Obersturm Fuher was in charge of the building of Sobibor.&nbsp; He was 
    shortly fired and S.S. Stangl was then put in charge.&nbsp; Sobibor was in a 
    rectangular shape with a three meter fence surrounding it, there was a 
    barb-wire on top to minimize the thought of escaping.&nbsp; Sobibor was the 
    second death camp in the Riehard Program. It was in a low populated area 
    called Sobibor.&nbsp; That is how the camp got it' s name.&nbsp; It was 
    roughly 1300ft. by 2000ft. It had three lines of fences and watch towers 
    every three hundred feet.&nbsp; It was finally finished in 1942. Sobibors 
    original&nbsp; gas chambers were made out of brick with a concrete floor. 
    The first practice extermination was in April 1942. They brought in 250 Jews 
    and they killed them all.&nbsp; After it was&nbsp; perfected the mass murder 
    of the Jews began.&nbsp; </font></td>

    The poison was from a diesel engine, the fumes where piped into the gas 
    chambers threw the walls. The fumes were carbon monoxide.&nbsp; There were 
    three parts to the camp Sobibor.&nbsp; The Administration area, that is 
    where the offices and the sleeping quarters for the S.S.&nbsp; The Reception 
    Area was where the prisoners got off the trains.&nbsp; In the Reception Area 
    the S.S. might be nice to you or they might beat you up.&nbsp; The 
    Westerners were tricked into getting on the trains.&nbsp; Some of them gave 
    the guards money for taking their bags.&nbsp; The Easterners got beat as 
    soon as they stepped foot off the trains.&nbsp; The guards thought that 
    lessened the thought of a revolt.&nbsp; The guards might sick dogs on them 
    and let them rip them to pieces because they thought it was funny. The third 
    area was the gas chamber that is where the prisoners got their hair shaved 
    then they had to take off all their cloths and put them in the piles of 
    clothes.&nbsp; After that the prisoners got sent down the tube that led down 
    to the gas chambers.</font></td>
