    Elie Wiesel was born in the small close-knit village of Sighet, Transylvania 
    on September 30, 1928.&nbsp; He was very close to his family and religious 
    studies.&nbsp; He had three sisters and his Orthodox Jew parents owned a 
    grocery store.&nbsp; Most of his thinking was deeply influenced by his 
    synagogues caretaker, Moshe, and maternal grandfather who was a devout 
    Hasidic Jew.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Elie's grandfather wanted him to focus on his religious studies and 
    classical Hebrew.&nbsp; His father however had different views and wanted 
    Elie to focus on secular studies and modern Hebrew.</font></p>

    anything too bad.&nbsp; All the Jews had to do was wear yellow stars.&nbsp; 
    Except for a few years later all Jews who could not prove Hungarian 
    citizenship were sent to extermination camps in Poland.&nbsp; Moshe was sent 
    away but escaped and came back to Sighet.&nbsp; He told stories of the 
    evilness and cruelty in the camps but no one would believe him and thought

    Life went on as usual.&nbsp; Elie celebrated his Bar Mitzvah and everyone 
    thought they were safe.&nbsp; Until the Nazis started clearing everybody 
    out.&nbsp; They destroyed Jewish homes, synagogues, cemeteries, and 
    businesses and set up two ghettos.</font></p>

    The Wiesel family was one of the last to be sent away.&nbsp; They were 
    crammed in a cattle car with 80 other people.&nbsp; Elie wrote in one of his 
    books, &quot;Life in the cattle cars was the death of my adolescence.&quot;&nbsp; 
    After about four days the train stopped at Auschwitz.&nbsp; Even though Elie 
    was 15 at the time he followed the instructions of a fellow prisoner and 
    told the waiting guard that he was 18, a farmer, and in good health.&nbsp; 
    So he and his father were sent to the labor camps while his Mother and 
    little sister were sent to the gas chambers.&nbsp; Elie was stripped of his 
    identity and became identified only by his number: A-7713. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    After about a year Elie and his father were sent to Buchenwald.&nbsp; Elie's 
    father died there shortly before the camp was liberated.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    After that Elie was sent to Buna then Gleiwitz surviving both.&nbsp; When 
    World War II was over he was put in a French orphanage with many other 
    children survivors of of the Holocaust.&nbsp; There he was given a choice 
    between religious and secular studies.&nbsp; Naturally he chose religious.&nbsp; 
    Elie said that the only time he was involved in secular things was his time 
    in Auschwitz.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Elie&nbsp; then studied at the Sorbonne in Paris and then became a 
    journalist for a small French newspaper.&nbsp; During an interview with a 
    French author he was convinced to write a book about the Holocaust.&nbsp; 
    The book <i>Night </i>was then born.&nbsp; It is a book of memoirs of his 
    time in the concentration camps.&nbsp; The book has sold more than 7,000,000 
    copies and has been translated into more than 30 languages.</font><p>
    <font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    After he wrote the book he learned that his older sisters were alive when 
    they saw his picture in the newspaper.&nbsp; He then traveled to New York 
    City and was hit by a car.&nbsp; He was in a wheelchair for more than a year 
    and it was then that he decided to get his American citizenship.&nbsp;
