    concentration camp:&nbsp; Mauthausen was located about 20km from Linz, 
    Austria.&nbsp; It was established in 1938.&nbsp; On May 5, 1945 Mauthausen 
    was liberated by the First Platoon of Troop D, But we'll get to that later.&nbsp; 
    The camp had an estimated number of 150,000 victims.&nbsp; Mauthausen had 
    about 10 sub-camps that lasted for some weeks, and 49 permanent sub-camps.&nbsp;

        <font face="Broadway" size="4" color="#FF3300">On August 8, 1938 Himmler 
        ordered a couple hundred prisoners to be transferred to the little town 
        of Mauthausen. There was a plan to build a new camp so they could supply 
        slave labor for the Wiener Grabben stone quarry.&nbsp; By 1939, most of 
        the prisoners were put to work building the camp and living quarters.&nbsp; 
        The main camp had 32 barracks surrounded by electric barbed wire fences.&nbsp; 
        There was also high stone walls and watch towers.&nbsp; </font>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Broadway" color="#FF00FF">The 
        guards would torture the prisoners by making them climb the 186 steps of 
        Wiener Grabben with large blocks of granite on their backs.&nbsp; Often 
        the blocks would fall and crush the limbs of the prisoners behind.&nbsp; 
        The block's would even kill the prisoner.&nbsp; The SS guards would have a 
        competition to see who could get to the top first.&nbsp; The survivors 
        would be forced to jump off of the side of the quarry.&nbsp; That spot 
        is known as the &quot;Parachute Jump.&quot;&nbsp; Prisoners would often get taken 
        to the top and would be told to fight.&nbsp; When two fighters fell, all 
        of the victors would be set free.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></td>
