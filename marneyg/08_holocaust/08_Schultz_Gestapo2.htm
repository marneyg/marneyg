    police battalions to follow behind the armies and kill all the Jews in

    thing that made the Gestapo so powerful was the bill of 1935 known as the 
    Schutzhaft. It let them do whatever they pleased. A bill was passed that 
    stated if anyone was arrested by the Gestapo their only right to trial was 
    an appeal to a higher ranked Gestapo. The Gestapo had a motto &quot; if you say 
    nothing no harm would come to you.&quot;</font></td>

    was the year the first Death Camps were created. Here are some usual reasons 
    people got arrested and/or sent to Death Camps. His/ Her attitude endangered 
    the people in the state, working with a resistance group, being 
    Jewish/Polish, refusal to work,&nbsp; loafing on the job, defeatist 
    statements, religious propaganda, sexual intercourse with a Pole or Jew, and 
    their are probably many more. Heinrich Himmler recorded that 2,000,000 Jews 
    were shot to death, this excludes the 4 million sent to be annihilated at 
    death camps.</font></td>

    Germany. But the enemy came and the Gestapo were almost no help to Germany.</font></td>
