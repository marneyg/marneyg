    Hitler and many other very powerful leaders decided on the Final Solution at 
    the Wannsee&nbsp; conference in January 1942. The Final Solution was Hitler's 
    idea to kill at least six million Jews in Europe before the wars end. Eleven 
    million Jews were planned to be involved in the Final Solution. The Final 
    Solution was the code name for the genocide of all Jews.</font><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; border-width: 0" width="100%">

        first step in the Final Solution was to get all Jews into ghettos or to 
        the east. Their were special laws passed to make the Jews live a more 
        dreadful life. These laws were called the Nuremburg laws, 400 of these 
        specific laws were passed by the German government. Hitler was winning

        The Nazi organization sent out killing squads to kill the Jews.

        decided they they needed to find a more efficient ways to exterminate 
        the Jews. some of these ways were crematoriums, electrocution, phenol 
        injections, flame throwers, hand grenades, and gas chambers. In 1942
