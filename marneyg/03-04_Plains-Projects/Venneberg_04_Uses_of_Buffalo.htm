      getting food. It required skill, good horses, and more skill. Cooking was
      the women's job. After the women gutted the animal they would start
      taking out all the body parts they were going to use. Storage was a
      vigorous process because when they were going to store the meat, they had
      to make jerky, pemmican, or saturate it in fat and keep out of the air in
      a buffalo hide bag. The buffalo also made many, many things. Some tribes,
      for example: Kootenai, would throw away all the insides except for the
      heart; where others would use everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></td>

      that they had everything. They needed a trained horse that didn't get
      scared when the buffalo was stampeding right next to them. They had to
      have all their equipment to shoot the buffalo. After they have that they
      needed to figure out if they would just start shooting them or if they
      would Piskin. Piskin is when the Indians trick them to stampede over a
      cliff. While hunting, the Indians had to decide if they wanted to keep
      hunting to add to the winter's supply of just get enough for everyone. If
      they wanted to keep hunting they would cache the meat. When they did this,
      they placed the meat between 2 hides some where out of the way and picked
      it up later. This was only temporary means of storage. After hunting they
      would start gutting it and take out all the parts they wanted. While this
      was happening they would snack on raw meat or drink the warm blood. They
      would even drink the gristle from the snout, They believed that if you
      drank the blood it would help you in battle when blood shed was
      everywhere. If they were hunting on enemy's land whole meals would be raw,
      uncooked meat so that nobody would see their smoke.</b></font></td>

      also used the marrow in the bones. They would set it next to the fire then
      crack it open and eat it. They also used it as a base for soup. They used
      hot, melted marrow and poured it into a rawhide bag that held pulverized
      jerky and whatever else they wanted in it. They sewed it shut then walked
      on it to flatten it to six or seven inches. One of the bags could weigh
      ninety pounds. Some popular dishes were boiled fetal buffalo calf and calf
      heads. To cook these they made fire pits and placed them in there. There
      was a two-inch-thick fatty tissue on the hump( the French called it
      &quot;depouille&quot;). The Blackfoot tribes would dip it into hot grease
      and hung it high in their lodge where it was smoked. Some used it as a
      bread and put jerky in between it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> </font></td>

      several choices of how to store it. The most popular long-time storage was
      dehydration They sliced the meat up thin, hung them on scaffolds with
      streamers placed with them, then when the wind blew, it helped keep the
      wolves away. They could saturate it in fat and with out contact with air
      it could last for a long time (it was concealed in a rawhide bag). Another
      way to keep meat was making it into pemmican or jerky. Dried buffalo jerky
      weighed 1/6&nbsp; what the original fresh meat weighed. when rain or damp
      air got to it, it usually started to mold and decay which would make it
      heavier. Jerky was often pounded then dipped in melted fat to make chewing
      easier, Pemmican eliminated problems with jerky.</b></font></td>

      Coats and capes, dresses and belts. Mittens and leggings, underclothes and
      Breech clothes. They made their tipi's and they made tipi covers. Door
      flops to bedcovers, medicine cases to trunks. They made ceremonial objects
      like: Sundance alters and rattles. They even made winding sheets for the
      dead. They made snow shoes to dice, netting for lacrosse hoops to ball
      covering and the stuffing. They made all the things for their horse like
      saddles, saddle blankets, and all the straps. They made pouches for tobacco
      and berries and even Honda rings. They made some of their weapons and got
      their bow strings. They got all their tools and utensils like eating
      utensils and buckets. Brushes, soaps, thread, and glue. They could even
      make a boat if they needed it.&nbsp;</b></font></td>
