    <td width="100%" colspan="2">The origin of this movement was found in a
      Pauite Indian named Wovoka, who said he was a messiah come to earth to
      ;prepare the Indians for salvation .&nbsp; It was suppose to last about
      five days and repeated every six weeks.&nbsp; Indians came from all over
      the nation to meet Wovoka and to learn Ghost Dance songs and dances after
      hearing of a performance where bullets stopped in front of Wovoka when he
      was wearing his ghost shirt.</td>

    <td width="100%" colspan="2">Wovoka received a revelation that the dead
      would rise, the Indians would live forever, the buffalo would return, and
      the whites would disappear.&nbsp; All the Indians who ghost danced
      believed that they would be suspended in the air while a new earth was
      being made.&nbsp; They thought that the next spring the new soil would
      bury the white man.&nbsp; They then would be the only ones who lived
      there.&nbsp; Wovoka was for innocent behavior: no fighting, no war,
      nothing to do with war, no stealing, no lying , and no cruelty .&nbsp; The
      ghost shirts were supposed to protect them from the soldiers
      bullets.&nbsp; On the Lakota tribe the women's ghost shirts were made of
      white cotton cloth.&nbsp; They were like a loose robe with wide, flowing
      sleeves, a painted blue neck with moons, stars, birds, etc. emblazoned
      upon them.&nbsp; The Lakota's men's ghost shirts were made of the same
      material with leggings painted in red stripes.&nbsp; The neck was painted
      blue with figures of everything they saw in nature.&nbsp; They also had
      rows of feathers down their sleeves.&nbsp; The Plains Indians wore two
      feathers in their hair so they would be lifted into the new world.&nbsp;
      Yellow Bird had said:
      <p align="center"><font face="Script MT Bold">&quot; The bullets will not
      go toward you.&nbsp; The prairie is Large... the bullets will not go
      toward you.&quot;</font></p>

    <td width="100%" colspan="2">By the autumn of 1890, trading ,schooling, and
      almost all activities came to a stop as the people took up this
      ritual.&nbsp; At first when Wovako danced, he experienced no revelation
      and told Kicking Bear, &quot; <font face="Script MT Bold">It is impossible
      for a dead man to return and live again.&quot;</font>&nbsp; Before the
      Lakota danced, a crowd gathered around the high priest who was giving
      directions to chant and other things.&nbsp; About fifteen minutes after he
      had spoken they stood directly beside each other with their hands on their
      neighbors shoulders.&nbsp; They shreiked out their grief and naming
      departed friends and relatives for about fifteen minutes.&nbsp; After
      chanting &quot;Father I come&quot; a few times, they stopped but stayed in
      their position and gave off the most god-awful, heart-piercing
      wails.&nbsp; One Kiowa ghost dance was called &quot;And&nbsp; I Wait With
      the Wind and My Faith&quot; and it went like this:
      <p align="center"><font face="Script MT Bold">The wind, the wind, Shakes
      my tipi, shakes my tipi, And sings a song for me, And sings a song for me.</font></p>
      <p align="left">Next, the excitement began.&nbsp; They would move their
      hands and bodies as fast they could with their hands gipping tightlly to
      their neighbors.&nbsp; If one came near falling he'd be jerked up.&nbsp;
      They kept dancing until at least one-hundred people were unconscious on
      the ground.&nbsp; Then they stopped, sat on the ground and listened to
      each other as they related their experiences.&nbsp; Ioways and members of
      other tribes were sick with disease and malnutrition.&nbsp; The dance,
      with its trances, helped with the grief .&nbsp; Big Foots Band would dance
      until they collapsed, hoping dead warriors would come back to life, but
      had no objections to the dance.</p>

    <td width="100%" colspan="2">Sitting Bull had heard agents getting nervous
      and calling in soldiers on reservations.&nbsp; He didn't want any more
      Indians getting killed but Kicking Bear assured him that the ghost shirts
      would protect them.&nbsp; Agents asked if the ritual was so peaceful why
      did they need &quot; bulletproof&quot; garments?&nbsp; The only white man
      on the Indians side was Valentine McGillycuddy,&nbsp; who said he should
      let the dance continue.&nbsp; Sitting Bull had said:
      <p align="center"><font face="Script MT Bold">&quot;Let the soldiers come
      and take me away and kill me, wherever they like.&nbsp; I am not
      afraid.&nbsp; I was born a warrior.&nbsp; I have followed the warpath ever
      since I was able to draw a bow.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left">Troops were told to maintain peace and by the end of
      1890, some 3,000 soldiers were in Sioux country.&nbsp; The ghost dance was
      banned among the Sioux, but it was still went on in the Badlands that were
      far from the agents.&nbsp; The Lakota's had no use of the ghost dance
      because they couldn't&nbsp; get the ghost shirts or ghost dances to work
      but agents banned the ghost dance on the Lakota reservations because the
      Ghost Dance promised some sort of violence to the wasicus anyways.&nbsp;
      Sitting Bull told Kicking Bear to stay at Standing Rock and teach the
      Ghost Dance but in telling him that Agent McLaughlin came and removed
      Kicking Bear.&nbsp; McLaughlin telegraphed Washington, asking for troops
      and blaming Sitting Bull for this &quot; pernicious system of
      religion.&quot;

      Bull Head entered the cabin Sitting Bull was asleep.&nbsp; Upon awakening,
      he peacefully agreed to come with the police.&nbsp; A large group of Ghost
      Dancers had assembled and challenged the police.&nbsp; One dancer,
      Catch-the-Bear, pulled a rifle out and shot Lt. Bull Head in the
      side.&nbsp; Bull Head tried to shoot back but shot Sitting Bull
      instead.&nbsp; Another policeman, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the
