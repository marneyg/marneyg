    <td width="100%" colspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is what lead to the battle. The first is
      mining. Why because in 1858 and 1859 discovery of gold was all over the
      place but the Black Hills were hot spot for mining. The Black Hills where
      in the territory of&nbsp; the Cheyenne, Sioux, Arapaho, Comanches, and
      Kiowa. The Indians were not happy about it. Thousands of people went to
      the hills and mining towns where starting. Then the Indians were attacking
      the towns and forts that were around the roads. So the government had a
      solution to it. The solution was to buy the Black Hills for six million
      dollars and Red Cloud refused the offer. The meeting ended with out an
      agreement but in December the roads were not to be used.</td>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%" colspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is meetings but there is one meeting that
      is very important to know about. It takes place in 1868 it was gen.
      Sherman's idea to have it. The purpose was to end in an agreement between
      him and Red Cloud as will as the other chiefs. Gen. Sherman wanted them to
      sign a treaty for the roads and not to harm them but the treaty was signed
      so the other Indians thought that the chiefs were selling them out but the
      white men didn't do what the treaty said because the roads where still used. The
      Indians were augury so they attacked the whites. Then the whites build
      Fort Phil. Kearny in the spring and summer of 1867 on Piney Creek and it
      was in the Heart land of Buffalo Country. After the building Red Cloud
      joined raids on the fort. He also said to determined to crush Fort Phil.
      Kearny and the wood train. So the meeting lead up to all of these thing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there was treaties. There was a lot of
      treaties signed but all of them where broken. The first treaty was an act
      of Congress it was on July 20,1867 commission a peace treaty. When the
      treaty was broken the peace Indians lead by Chief Black Kettle. The white
      Antelope went to the reservation that was set a side&nbsp; for them. On September 13 Red Cloud and the other chiefs meet at Fort Laramie for the
      treaty. After the treaty&nbsp; was&nbsp; signed&nbsp; by the chiefs many
      of the Sioux felt that Red Cloud had sold them out to the white man and
      them joined&nbsp; Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. But Custer ignored the
      treaty of 1868 turned and invaded Black Kettle. The government tried to
      keep the Indians away from the forts and all of the places white man were.
      So Treaties were broken and so that brings it to the next thing ,battles. </td>

    <td width="100%" colspan="2">&nbsp; Next is battles that lead up to the battle of
      the Little Bighorn. On June 1,1866 Taylor initiated two thousand Brules
      and Ogalola assembled. so they could agree on the treaty on the roads.
      From that first day of July to December 21,1866 Red Cloud and worriers
      killed ninety-one soldiers, five officers and 58 citizens. Then there was
      the U.S. men and they had thousand warriors and they were only five
      hundred warriors for the Sioux. That was the first battle that the Indians
      had ever fought against guns. The white men shoot at the Indians were
      fifty-yards away. Then there was the Sand Creek Massacre on November
      29,1864. All the plains Indians who where in or head of the measure they
      started to stand their ground and defined their
      land.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

      what happen in the battle of the Little Bighorn. Here is what is going to

    <td width="50%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off you all ready know about the
      things that lead up to the battle but you don't know what happen in the
      battle. So here it goes, Here is the people that took place in the battle
      and how many of them on each side. The first person is Custer and the
      Seventh Cavalry with 700men. On the Indians side there were Sioux,
      Cheyenne and there were 10,000 to 15,000 but only 3,000 to 4,000 were
      warriors. Then Custer divided his troops into three battalions. HE sent
      tree companies under Captain F.W. to go scout the bluffs that were left.
      Then three companies under Major M.A.Reno. Then five companies under
      himself. They went in opposite banks to get to the Indians on the Little
      Bighorn Valley. The Indians where under Red Cloud and Man Afraid of His
      Horse </td>

    <td width="100%" colspan="2">&nbsp; Then there was how long was the battle. The fight

      battle was over. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" colspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Then what all things they did in the battle,
      here it goes. Custer and the Seventh Cavalry fought the indians on June25,
      1876. Then the indians chased the troops and them went for Custer. After
      an hour all of the troops under Custer's command where dead so the
      Indiansstripped,scalped,and mutilated all of them but Custer they stabbed
      his ears for what they said so he can hear them better in the next
      live.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%" colspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Custer's command in cluting Custer lost 100 to
      300 men in the battle. And the indians where very happy because it was the
      most greatest victory ever. </td>

    <td width="50%">&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok then it is to the third main idea. It is
      what is there know. first the monuments. What monument is the monument
      that has all the names of the people in the Seventh Cavalry. Then there is
      graves but the graves are for the Indians and the White men. There is over
      5,000 headstones on the hill at Montana. Then there is the question why is
      it there&nbsp; because the government wanted to recognized all who fought
      at the battle of the Little Bighorn.&nbsp; </td>
