      The Sioux have many great aspects like there
      territory that they controlled. This web page will talk about the lands
      the Sioux came from, the northern Minnesota region, where they went from
      there, and where they are now&nbsp; in present day.&nbsp; This page will
      also talk about the buffalo and its importance to the Sioux culture.&nbsp;
      It's importance ranges from a food source to tools and other items made
      from its bones and skin.&nbsp; Also this page will try to shed some light
      on why the buffalo dyed out.&nbsp; Finally this page is going to explain
      about some of the major events on the history of the Sioux like Sitting
      Bulls death, what happened at Wounded Knee an after Wounded Knee what
      happened to the Sioux.&nbsp; Then finally It'll explain about how Wounded
      Knee and the death of Sitting Bull is connected with the Ghost Dance

      When the Sioux didn't have horses they lived in
      western Minnesota.&nbsp; They where just a normal woodland tribe, medium
      in size.&nbsp; They lived off of small game, deer, and wild rice.&nbsp; Occasionally
      they went out onto the plains to hunt buffalo.&nbsp; The first whites they
      came in contact with where French traders.&nbsp; Later it is noted by
      there tradition the French thought they came from the northeast some time
      before that.&nbsp; In the late 1700's to the early 1800's the Sioux discovered
      horses and used them to move onto the plains where they would be know as fierce
      fighters off horse back and good allies.&nbsp; There they gained there
      land the Black Hills and the Bozeman trail.&nbsp; There they first encountered
      the Army and the problems with the white man begins. the life of the Sioux
      on the plains depended on the buffalo at this time.</td>

The buffalo on the plain was the life force of the Sioux.&nbsp; They where the
most important food source to the Sioux tribes.&nbsp; They fed the Sioux since
the moved out onto the plains. the Sioux used the buffalo for many tools like spoons
and bowls.&nbsp; They used the smaller bones for needles and the sinews for
thread.&nbsp; They also used some of the larger bones for war clubs and other weapons.&nbsp;
They also used the buffalo to burry there dead.&nbsp; First they would wrap the
body in a buffalo hide then using strips of buffalo hid make a platform 5-6 feet
off the ground.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Sioux people where shock when they found out
that the white people buried&nbsp; there dead underground. They believed it
would&nbsp; prevent the soul of the body from from leaving to go into the
afterlife. After a while the Sioux started to stray from there traditional
burial to putting a wooden coffin on a platform then to setting a coffin on the
ground to burying the coffin underground like the whites.&nbsp; Why the buffalo disappeared
from the plains is almost interlay whites fault because they started the mass
killing of buffalo.&nbsp; The hundreds of thousands of buffalo that where killed
by &quot;professional buffalo killers&quot; finally took its toll on the buffalo
population and killed off the buffalo almost entirely.&nbsp; This caused the
Sioux and other Indians to depend on government food rations which where small
and sometimes didn't even come. That is what caused the fall of the great Sioux
nation some experts think.</td>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major
    events in Sioux history are linked.&nbsp; It was like a chain reaction all
    starting with the buffalo.&nbsp; When the buffalo disappeared the Indians
    had to move to reservations to receive government food rations and life on
    the reservations was cramped and miserable.&nbsp; This led to the Ghost
    Dance Religion.&nbsp; The Ghost Dance religion consisted of dancing in a circle
    until the dancer became so dizzy he fell down and went into a trance like state
    there they would have visions.&nbsp; The Ghost Dance religion was supposed
    to bring back the dead, restore the lands, drive the whites away, and bring
    back the buffalo.&nbsp; This led to some white settlers getting scared because
    of this and asked the government to do something about this.&nbsp; The government
    reacted by trying to arrest Sitting Bull a famous Sioux leader that supported
    the Ghost Dance religion. When he was being arrested he resisted and was
    shot and killed by a solder.&nbsp; After this the band that was led by
    Sitting Bull was led by Bid foot toward the badlands. As they tried to get
    there they where captured by the 7th Calvary on December 28, 1890.&nbsp;
    There they reached Wounded Knee.&nbsp; There they where ordered to disarm
    but when there medicine man though a hand full of dust into the air a young
    worrier lunged at a nearby officer and was killed.&nbsp; Then the solder opened
    fired&nbsp; on the Indians and killed all of them.&nbsp; The army later
    claimed that it was hard to distinguish men from women.&nbsp; After that the
    will of the Indians broke and they went to reservations in the late 1800's
    and early 1900's.&nbsp;&nbsp;
