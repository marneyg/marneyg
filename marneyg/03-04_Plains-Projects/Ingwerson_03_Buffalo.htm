      horses arrived were called the Buffalo Pound and the Buffalo Jump, but
      other methods were used also.&nbsp; The Buffalo Pound was where they lured
      buffalo into a corral made out of logs and then killed them with spears or
      arrow heads.&nbsp; The Buffalo Jump was when they chased the buffalo over
      a cliff while other Indians waited at the bottom and killed the injured
      buffalo.&nbsp; Other methods they used where when they covered themselves
      in buffalo or wolf skins and would follow the buffalo and wait for the
      best time to kill them.</font></p>

      The buffalo is the very sources of life for the plains Indians.&nbsp; From
      the buffalo they got meat for food, skins for tipis, fur for robes, and
      anything else was for tools and things needed for everyday life.&nbsp; All
      the things made from the buffalo weren't needed.&nbsp; Like the teeth were
      used as decorations and the hooves were used to make glue.&nbsp; Most of
      the buffalo was needed though.&nbsp; Like the bones and horns&nbsp; were
      used to make hoes, digging sticks, hide working tools, cups, and
      spoons.&nbsp; The paunch and the bladder&nbsp;&nbsp; were used as cooking
      utensils.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a thing was wasted on the buffalo.&nbsp;
      Everything was used.&nbsp; Bones, hooves, insides, horns, and hides.&nbsp;
      Even the buffalo's dung was used to make fuel.&nbsp; The most useful part
      of the animal was its hide.&nbsp; The thickest skin went into shield and
      the soles of&nbsp; winter moccasins and came from the old bulls. The
      thinnest was from the unborn calves and was used for berry bags.&nbsp; The
      hair was left on the hides for winter garments.&nbsp; As for other uses
      they were scraped clean.&nbsp; Sometimes it would age so it for two
      different purposes.&nbsp; The upper part of cowhide was a tipi
      cover.&nbsp; It eventually became rainproof by grease and smoke.&nbsp;
      Where it was then cut up and stitched together into clothing to be worn in
      wet season.</font></td>

      Depending on your tribe the men or women could butcher the buffalo.&nbsp;
      The Blackfoot&nbsp; though it was a man's job.&nbsp; The Miami tribe
      preferred women.&nbsp; Father Louis Hennepin observed in the 1600's that
      the&nbsp; women of the Miami tribe could handle very well.&nbsp; He noted:</font></p>

          are so lusty and strong, that they carry on their back two or three
          hundred&nbsp; weight, besides children, and not withstanding that
          burden, they ran as swiftly as any of out soldiers with their arms.'</font></p>

      </blockquote>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 150%; margin: 0"><font face="Comic Sans MS">While they were
      butchering they snacked on raw pieces of meat.&nbsp; In order to get
      something to drink or tot get to the brains they had to bash holes in the
      buffalo's skull.&nbsp; Then they slit the stomach and they dug their
      insides out.&nbsp; After that they got thirsty and they would scoop the
      blood out with their hands.&nbsp; They hadn't had any thing to drink for a
      while the blood helped them to quench their thirst.&nbsp; They also used
      the blood in soups.</font></p>

      gotten worse in the 1860's because of the railroads.&nbsp; Instead of
      importing meat the railroad managers hired hunters to kill the
      buffalo.&nbsp; The slaughter made the tribes be reduced to none.&nbsp;
      Where once they had known plenty now they only knew little.&nbsp; Once the
      railroads were finished buffalo became fun for sportsmen out West.&nbsp;
      About ten years later a Pennsylvania firm discovered that the hides could
      be made&nbsp; into leather.&nbsp; The buffalo skins were then sold for $3
      a piece.&nbsp; Now the hunters weren't just out there for fun they really
      wanted the buffalo skins.&nbsp; Sometimes 4-5&nbsp; hunters could shoot
      and skin about 50 buffalo a day.&nbsp; One hunter accompanied by
      professional&nbsp; skinners claimed to have killed and skinned 1,500 in a
      week.&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter how many times the Indians beat the white
      hunters and skinners it wouldn't make up for the missing buffalo.&nbsp; If
      buffalo were gone the Indians would starve to death and then be forced on
      to a reservation.</font></td>

      the last decade of the buffalo.&nbsp; The Senate and the House both tried
      to pass a bill to protect the buffalo but the President didn't sign
      it.&nbsp; So as more people came more buffalo died.&nbsp; In 1800 there
      was probably 60 million buffalo.&nbsp; In about 1870 the number was 13
      million.&nbsp; By the turn of the century there were only 1,000 buffalo
