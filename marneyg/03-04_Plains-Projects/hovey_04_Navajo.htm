      from the very beginning. The fist meeting of representatives from the
      United States government did not go so peacefully, there was a misunderstanding in which seven to
      nine Navajo were killed, this alone should have warned to Navajo of the
      danger they faced&nbsp;ahead, yet at their next meeting they agreed to fully cooperate with the
      United States, perhaps this is why the Navajo were killed in the first
      meeting, but that is&nbsp;only&nbsp;speculation and may have had nothing to do with the
      misunderstanding at all.</td>

      hostile times between&nbsp;Indians and the United States in peace. But they too faced
      difficult times, they were forced to walk to tread a path similar to the
      trail of tears, if you are not&nbsp;familiar with that, the Cherokees were forced, in winter, across
      the country to a new &quot;home&quot; to make room for more citizens to
      live on toward the west. The rations were so scarce that some Navajo girls became prostitutes
      for the soldiers to get money for food. Luckily the Navajo are highly adaptive, when their&nbsp;&quot;home&quot;, called
      Basque Redondo in the East
      was over crowded they were moved back to their traditional homeland. however, they were forced
      to farm the harsh&nbsp;and sandy New Mexican soil. But, once again they
      proved their adaptability and prospered, as a gift, for their prosperity
      they were given two mills to grind corn&nbsp;and wheat to make some of their traditional
      meals.&nbsp;

    <td width="100%" colspan="2">Their culture itself was very unique, the Navajo followed
      the Peyote Way, one major thing with this is smoking peyote and entering a
      sweat hut to await visions. The Navajo call themselves the Dine', which means &quot; Walk in Beauty&quot;. Their traditional homes were dirt domes called Hogan's, every
      Hogan's door faced&nbsp;toward&nbsp;the East. It is a custom to set a place at the table when a guest
      walks in the door. Most Navajo foods are either in the form of a type of
      bread or a soup,&nbsp;the traditional drink for the adults is coffee. The Navajo were, and still are very skilled weavers, from this it is
      thought that they have adopted various skills and&nbsp;some beliefs from many
      other Indian cultures. They also herded animals such as sheep and cattle for many uses.

      settlements, like some nearby rival Indian camps, and some other settlers
      camps. However, after Mexico&nbsp;lost the land that is today New Mexico and Utah, the Navajo's
      raiding was stopped by the order the of the United States. The United
      States took as much&nbsp;control as possible over the Navajo, they had to renegotiate even so simple
      a thing as food and water rights. Yet, they did just that
      and went along under&nbsp;that United State's boot. Reward or not for the things they have
      done they, like all Indians, were very mistreated. Yet there culture has
      survived the passing times&nbsp;and still exists today in their traditional homeland in New
      Mexico, Utah, and Arizona. </td>
