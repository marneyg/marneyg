      Horse&nbsp; was a very handsome man and physically perfect. he was a true
      type of Indian.&nbsp; He was modest, courteous and a born warrior, but he
      was gentle. big-heartedness, generosity and denial are the needs of a
      public servant and this is what most Indians followed.</font> </td>

      When Crazy&nbsp; Horse was a boy his name was not Crazy Horse it was Curly
      because his hair was so curly. curly was born in 1842. Curly loved horses
      and his father gave him a pony of his own. He was a fine horseman. His
      father was the Oglala medican man. His wife was sister was mother sister
      of spotted tail. When he was twelve he saved his younger brother from a
      bear. His mother died when he was vary young and his father took her
      sister as a new wife and she helped raise curly. When curly was young he received
      a vision quest witch had a vision of a rider in a storm on horse back. Had
      long unbraided hair, a stone in his ear, lighting on his cheek and hail
      stones dotting his body. He had no scalps. people held on to the rider but
      they could not hold him. The storm faded and a red-backed hawk flew over
      the rider's head. Latter he told his father and his father saw it as a
      sign of his future greatness in battle. he changed Curly's name to Crazy
      Horse. he rode for the first time with adult warriors in a raid on
      crows.&nbsp; He dressed like the man in his vision but he carried two
      scalps.&nbsp; He got a wound in the leg. From then on he never took
      another scalp with him&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> </td>

      things Crazy Horse did and lots of battles he fought in. One reason Crazy
      Horse wasn't fun-loving was because he had seen way to much violence as a
      child. At&nbsp; the time of the argument over the cow he was visiting his
      mothers people, the Brule. He had been in the camp when Lieutenant Grattan
      had come with soldiers and cannons&nbsp; to arrest the man who had killed the
      cow. Curly had seen what happened to Brave Bear, Grattan, and his soldiers.&nbsp;
      Later the boy had come upon the Brule village when General Harney and
      soldiers had killed eighty-six people. Even when he lost, Crazy Horse
      remained&nbsp; an independent spirit. Crazy Horse saved a peerless warrior
      named Hump and they became very good friends. They were known as
      &quot;the grizzly and his cub&quot;. Crazy Horse usually did not kill his
      enemy. Usually he just struck them with a switch. He fought the opening
      engagement war for the Black Hills in 1876-1877 in the battle of Powder
      River. Crazy Horse waged war in the early 1870's. He did raids on the
      northern pacific rail way. Crazy Horse became a war chief for the Oglalas
      with some Brule followers. He&nbsp; made friends and followers among the Cheyenne's
      because of his first marriage to a Cheyenne woman.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      21 years old when all the Teton Sioux chiefs met in council to decide on
      their future policy towards the white invaders. Their former agreement had
      been by individual band each for themselves.&nbsp; Every one was friendly.&nbsp;
      They
      believed that this country was wide and that the white trader should be
      made welcome.&nbsp; Up to this time they had anticipated no conflict.&nbsp;
      They had
      permitted the Oregon trail, but then to forts were built and armed in their
      territory. The Black hills gold rush brought whites to the region and
      increased tension. the nomadic hunting tribes ignored the order to report
      to reservations by January31-1876. The military organized campaigns
      against them in the early 1870's. It was told that the most chiefs wanted a strong resistance. A Few
      wanted still to live in peace. White decide in
      1866to defend there&nbsp; rights and territory by force. Crazy Horse took
      no part in the discussion in the fort Laramie treaty of&nbsp; 1868.The
      army agreed to abandon their posts along the Boze man trail Red cloud and
      spotted Tail settled on reservation lands.&nbsp;</font> </td>

      and formed a series of camps stretching out from there to four miles. They
      kept separate camps. On June 17 many troops advanced to them under the command
      of general cook the council sent Crazy Horse with seven hundred men to
      meet and attack him. they set out at night and unexpectedly came upon some
      of his crow scouts. Soldiers had their warning. Crazy Horse charged with
      his bravest men in attempt to bring the troops in drawing their fire. He
      withdrew and came back to the camp disappointed. after the Lakota victory
      at little bighorn, Sitting Bull and Gall retreated to Canada.&nbsp; Crazy
      Horse remained to fight general nelson all through the winter of

      Nebraska in 1877.&nbsp; He was thirty-three years old he was never involved
      in any of the many massacres on the trail.&nbsp; He was a leader
      in practically every open fight.&nbsp; When he reached Camp Bigman, the
      military camp, he walked arm in arm with his cousin and friend,
      Touch-the-Cloud.&nbsp; Touch-the-Cloud was just ahead.&nbsp; He was
      unarmed except for a knife which men and women usually carried.&nbsp; He
      walked to the guard house, when Touch-the-Cloud turned back shouting
      &quot;Cousin they'll put you in prison!&quot;&nbsp; Crazy Horse replied
      &quot;Another white man's trick!&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Let me die
      fighting!&quot; he cried!&nbsp; He tried to free himself and tried to pull
      out his knife.&nbsp; Both arms were held tight by Little Bigman.&nbsp; A
      soldier stabbed him with his bayonet from behind.&nbsp; He died in the
      course of the night while his father sang the death song over him.&nbsp;
      His body was given to his father and stepmother and was buried somewhere
