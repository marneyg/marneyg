      When most people hear
      the name George Armstrong Custer, they think of him as one of the best
      Indian soldier fighters ever.&nbsp; Or they think of one of the best
      cavalry leaders of the army of his time.&nbsp; People also think of a man
      with blonde hair and a mustache.</font></b></td>

      On December 5, 1839,
      Maria and Emanuel had a baby boy, named George Armstrong Custer.&nbsp; He
      had three brothers and a sister.&nbsp; Custer grew up on a farm in New
      Rumley, Ohio.&nbsp; He&nbsp; went to West Point and in 1861 he graduated
      last in his class.&nbsp;</font></b></td>

      In 1864 he got married
      to Elizabeth bacon.&nbsp; But that didn't stop him for long, because in
      March of that year he was back in fighting with the cavalry of the army of
      the Potomac.&nbsp; Cuter was named General of Volunteers, in 1865 when&nbsp;

      But in 1866 he was made
      lieutenant colonel of the 7th cavalry, where he remained until his
      death.&nbsp; The first official thing that he did was to organize a
      band.&nbsp; The first song they learned how to play was the Garry Owen
      song, because one day Custer over heard&nbsp; an Irish man in his cavalry
      singing it.&nbsp; It had an up beat to it so Custer made his men play it
      over and over.&nbsp; Soon the 7th cavalry was known as the Garry Owen
      Regiment.&nbsp;
      Because of George, much later the Garry Owen was the first official song
      for the first cavalry in 1881.&nbsp; In 1867 he finally got to go head to
      head with the Indians, one of his most famous quotes came from that
      fight.&nbsp; &quot; Let's kick their ass and get the hell out of

      returned to fort Leavenworth he was served with paper from the army that
      he was going to be charged with AWOL ( absent without leave ).&nbsp; In
      September Custer was found guilty and suspended from the army for one
      year, without pay.&nbsp; So he went back to Kentucky to be with his wife.</font></b></td>

      In 1868, he was back in action
      fighting in the battle of Washita.&nbsp; This was his first battle with
      the Cheyenne Indians.&nbsp; This battle was very controversial, because of
      a quote like &quot; Hurrah, Boys!&nbsp; We've Got Them.&quot;&nbsp; His
      controversial battles didn't stop there, the battle of Black Kettle was
      just as much talked about, because it was in the early morning and most of
      the Indians were asleep.&nbsp; Most people say that Custer was the one
      really responsible for that battle being fought.</font></b></td>

      two years ( 1870-1872 ) the 7th cavalry was not around battle.&nbsp; But
      during 1871 Custer lead the 7th cavalry to Kentucky to buy horses for the
      United States Army.&nbsp; He was also supposed to enforce the taxes there.
      Then in&nbsp; 1873 Custer was back, because settlers found gold in the
      Dakota Territories, Custer was called out to protect the minors, settlers,
      and railroad workers who were trying to cross the Yellow Stone
      River.&nbsp; But the problem was that the Sioux Indians owned that land
      and now the Government wanted it back.&nbsp; Custer tried to buy it with 6
      million dollars, but the Sioux refused the money.&nbsp; When they refused,
      Custer decided to get as many people as he could to settle on the land
      hoping the Indians would retreat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></td>

      In 1876, General Alfred Terry came to him with a propitiation.&nbsp; He
      wanted Custer along with John Gibbon to help him move all the Indians out
      of the open plain reservations.&nbsp; So in May he rode out of Fort Lincoln
      with 1,200 men towards the reservations.&nbsp; fearing the Indians would
      escape, he made a plan of attack from the south.&nbsp; Captain Benteen was
      to come from the southwest and Custer was to go straight threw the Indian
      village.&nbsp; Custer's goal was to destroy most of the Indians before
      anybody else got there.</font></b></td>

      But little did he know, that it would be his last battle.&nbsp; The Battle
      of Little Bighorn is one of the most talked about because not a sole
      person under Custer's command was found alive.&nbsp; It is said that only
      one horse made it, and it's name was </b><b>Comanche</b><b>.&nbsp; He was
      found with arrows all over his body.&nbsp; That battle ground became known
      as the grave yard.&nbsp; Later on in the year soldiers came back and dug
      up what was known to be Custer's remains and moved him back to West
      Point.&nbsp;</b></font></td>

      After the battle of Little Bighorn the settlers told the government that
      they wanted revenge.&nbsp; So the battle was known as Custer's Last Stand
      and most of the Indians were caught and became prisoners of war.&nbsp;
      When he died his wife was given 4,750 dollars because Custer had taken out
      a life insurance policy in 1873, for 5,000, but it was said that he took
      out a loan for 250 during his life.&nbsp; Also she was&nbsp; paid the
      money because they didn't have a war clause back then stating that if you
      were killed during a battle/war they didn't have to pay it.&nbsp;</font></b></td>
