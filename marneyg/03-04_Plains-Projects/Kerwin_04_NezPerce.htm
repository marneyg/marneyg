      names by the French because some of the Nez Perce wore nose pendents.&nbsp;
      After the introduction of horses the Nez Perce were then noted after that
      to be horse breeders and this made buffalo hunting easier.&nbsp; In 1805
      the Nez Perce&nbsp; were visited by Lewis an Clark.&nbsp; In 1830 they
      sent leaders and chiefs to St. Louis to ask for books and teachers.&nbsp;
      In 1855 they gave away a large part of their land to the United States.</td>

    <td width="50%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The War of 1877 was the non-treaty
      Nez Perce against U.S. troops.&nbsp; In 1877 most of the Nez Perce were
      living on reservations, but some of them refused to move.&nbsp; The leader
      of one Nez Perce tribe was Chief Joseph.&nbsp; Chief Joseph inherited the
      leadership because his father died and Joseph was elected new
      leader.&nbsp; In 1877 Chief Joseph led, one of the most brilliant retreats
      in Indian history with it scanning over 1,500 miles.&nbsp; The Nez Perce
      won many battles along the way only fighting troops if they came to close
      or were engaged.&nbsp; Joseph refused to leave the Wallowa Valley, given
      to the U.S. by the Treaty of 1863, because Joseph and the Nez Perce never
      signed it.&nbsp; General Oliver Howard was ordered to remove the Nez Perce.&nbsp;
      Joseph was finally going to agree and start to move his people to the
      reservation, but before they could leave a band of his own Indians slipped
      away and killed eighteen settlers.&nbsp; Howard was furious and sent
      Captain David Perry to bring in all of the Nez Perce.&nbsp; At Whitebird
      Canyon Perry attacked, but the Nez Perce were ready and drove them back,
      thirty-three soldiers died at Whitbird Canyon, but only three Nez Perce
      warriors died.&nbsp; After the battle, the indians did nothing to the
      dead.</td>

      abandon stage stop called Cotton Wood they fought off another
      attack.&nbsp; On July 11th they killed thirteen more of Howard's men at
      the Clearwater River.&nbsp; In the Clearwater battle Looking Glass joined
      the Nez Perce and strengthened their warriors greatly.&nbsp; Afterwards
      they had to climb the Bitterroot Mountains.&nbsp; At this time Looking
      Glass led them.&nbsp; They were following the trail that had led Lewis and
      Clark to them just must more than seven centuries earlier.&nbsp; There
      were about seven-hundred people but only two-hundred of those were
      warriors the rest were women and children.&nbsp; Even though they had all
      these women and children they moved fast.&nbsp; They were hoping that if
      they made it to Montana they could join there allies the Crow.&nbsp; When
      they finally made it to Montana they turned south following the Bitterroot
      River.&nbsp; Sometimes they would&nbsp; stop in towns so they could get
      supplies.&nbsp; Some of the towns were scared and asked for army
      protection.</td>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Big Hole Looking Glass convinced
      the elders they could rest for many days, because he thought Howard was
      many days back, but what Looking Glass didn't know was that Colonel John
      Gibbons had mustered a small army of troops and had tracked the Nez Perce
      to Big Hole.&nbsp; At dawn on August 9th at Big Hole Colonel Gibbons
      attacked and at first ninety Nez Perce died, mostly women and children,
      but the remaining Nez Perce and warriors regrouped and drove the remaining
      soldiers out of the camp.&nbsp; The warriors trapped Gibbons and his men
      while Joseph led the rest to safety.&nbsp; After Big Hole the Nez Perce
      went back to Idaho then east to the Yellowstone Plateau&nbsp; The Nez
      Perce captured more than a dozen settlers and murdered two before they let
      the rest go.&nbsp; They still went seeking the Crow, but what they didn't
      know was that the Crow were chasing them on behalf of the military.</td>

      finally they crossed there final the Missouri.&nbsp; They had come more
      than 1,500 miles, fought in more than seventeen engagements, and had
      fought more than two-thousand Indian scouts and soldiers.&nbsp; They had

      from Canada they took a final break before their final journey to
      freedom.&nbsp; They knew that Howard was more than two days march back,
      but who they didn't know about was Colonel Nelson A. Miles. Miles had
      pushed his unit through Montana to intercept the Nez Perce.&nbsp; Also
      fighting with Mile's army were Cheyenne and Lakota warriors.&nbsp; The
      Bear Paw battle was the last battle for both sides.&nbsp; The soldiers
      charged at dawn but the Indians were ready and drove back the first, the
      second, and the third attack.&nbsp; The Nez Perce killed or wounded
      fifty-three soldiers but all of there horses had been driven off and they
      couldn't escape.&nbsp; The weather turned cold an Miles dug in for a siege.&nbsp;
      Some of the Indians slipped behind the lines and made their way into
      Canada.&nbsp; Sitting Bull welcomed them warmly but would send no
      help.&nbsp; Miles opened negotiations and said if they turned over their
      rifles that in the Spring they could return to the Wallowa Valley.&nbsp;
      The people were divided about surrendering but Jospeh couldn't bare to see
      his people suffer.&nbsp; He also believed Miles about
      returning to their homeland.&nbsp; On October 5, 1877, Chief Joespeh or
      the &quot;Red Nepolean&quot; ,as he was known to the whites, rode out on
      his horse, got off, and handed over his rifle to Miles in token of
      surrender.&nbsp; Chief Joseph gave one of the most eloquent surrender
      speeches ever. </td>

      Territory where they thought they would stay the winter, but on the way
      the promise that Miles had made about them returning to their homeland was
      overruled by General William Tecumseh Sherman.&nbsp; when the Nez Perce

      were told that they weren't returning to their homeland in Oregon, but to
      exhile in Indian Territory.&nbsp; Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce were once
      again betrayed.&nbsp; In this new territory conditions were unlivable and supplies
      were scarce.&nbsp; Sixty-eight Indians died in the first year alone.&nbsp;
      Not long after they had a cemetery set aside just for babies with a
