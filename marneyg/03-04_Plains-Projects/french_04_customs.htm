      <b>Most Plains Indians lived in a huge area between the Mississippi and
      Rocky Mountains.&nbsp; A few well-known tribes are the following: Sioux,
      Cheyenne, Comanche, and Blackfoot all lived in this area.&nbsp; One custom
      of the Plains Indians was that their tribes often traded among each other
      for supplies and food.&nbsp; Males usually wore animal skin leggings, a
      loin cloth, and a belt.&nbsp; Women and girls wore dresses made of
      deerskin.&nbsp; An important dance to the Plains Indians was the Ghost
      Dance that took place at night.&nbsp; Here they talked to the Gods and
      their ancestors that had past away.&nbsp; Southeastern tribes lived in
      states such as Louisiana, Georgia, and Alabama. Some of the Southeastern
      tribes were the following:&nbsp; Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole.&nbsp; The
      Green Corn Festival was one of the most important ceremonies to the Plains
      Indians.&nbsp; It took place in the fall and Shamans and men went in a
      circle around a fire that was cooking corn.&nbsp; After the corn was
      cooked it was given as a sacred offering to the Great Spirit.&nbsp; People
      danced and more corn was cooked over the fire for everyone.&nbsp; The
      Southeastern tribes were also famous for intermarriage.&nbsp; A Shawnee
      Chief, Blue Jacket, was an adopted Caucasian.&nbsp; There was also an
      African American, John Horse, who was a Seminole warrior.&nbsp; The
      Southeastern tribes contained a mix of races and tribes, but nobody seemed
      to mind, as long as the culture was the same everyone was happy.</b></font></td>

      Plains Indians has many customs.&nbsp; Their customs related to food are
      as follows:&nbsp; The Plains Indians hunted buffalo and other game for
      example they hunted elk and antelope, as well.&nbsp; To capture them
      they'd surround the herd or sometimes try to stamped a herd off of a cliff
      or into an area where they could kill them more easily.&nbsp; But after
      horses the lives of the Plains Indians was much easier.&nbsp; They would
      hunt animals using bows and arrows while riding horses.&nbsp; They never
      stopped hunting, they hunted all year long, because buffalo weren't in
      short supply, then.&nbsp; Buffalo, after being roasted over a fire and
      dried in the sun, was then made into jerky, and made into pemmican, which
      was made by pounding dried meat into powder and mixing it with melted fat
      and berries.&nbsp; The Plains Indians didn't eat only meat, they ate
      berries, cherries, wild greens, camas roots, and wild prairie turnips with
      the meat, as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; They made about every single part of the
      dead buffalos useful to them. Which are only a few of the very many
      customs the Plains Indians had to stay alive and get food.</font></b></td>

      beliefs.&nbsp; They believed in the Great Spirit.&nbsp; They believed the
      Great Spirit had power over all things, including animals, trees, clouds,
      humans, and rocks.&nbsp; Plains Indians also believed that the earth was
      the mother of all spirits.&nbsp; The sun was believed to give the earth
      light and warmth, so it was powerful in their beliefs, also.&nbsp; They
      prayed both alone and in groups together.&nbsp; They had many customs to
      worship the Great Spirit, and they believed in visions that came from the
      spirits.&nbsp; A medicine man or known as shaman was their guide to
      healing the sick and interpreting signs and dreams.&nbsp; One very
      important custom was the Sun Dance, a very important ceremony among them
      that lasted for many days.&nbsp; First, they would fast, not eating for
      several days at a time.&nbsp; They wouldn't sleep either, and then they
      would set up camp, a circle of tepees.&nbsp; A tree was set in the center
      for the ritual.&nbsp; Ropes made of hair and leather were then tied to the
      top of the tree.&nbsp; Next, they tied the ropes to sticks, which they
      stuck through the&nbsp; flesh of their chests and backs.&nbsp; Then, they
      continued to dance, worshipping the sun, playing pipes, and all the while
      the sticks tore at their flesh more and more, but they believed this would
      make the Great Spirit proud and they would be rewarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></td>

      The Plains Indians that were artist used buffalo hides to draw on, which
      were made into clothing, houses, beds, shields, shoes (moccasins),
      envelopes, and other useful objects for the Plains Indians.&nbsp; The
      objects were painted or beaded into beautiful patterns, such as stripes,
      diamonds, arrows, hunting scenes, and other things that represented their
      lives and customs.&nbsp; Medicine bundles were also customary to be
      carried by the Indians.&nbsp; They carried pipes, dried herbs, and other
      animal related things in the medicine bundles because they believed they
      represented powerful objects.&nbsp; The medicine bags were supposed to
      help heal the Plains Indians, spiritually and physically.&nbsp; Another
      custom was the Powwow, which was another ceremony often held from June
      until September.&nbsp; Powwows had religious importance and opportunities
      to hold a naming.&nbsp; Dakota and Lakota traditions in the powwows were
      to pray and celebrate the Great Spirit, or to them known as Wakantanka.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The Indians stood in a circle, which was also very important to
      them.&nbsp; They danced in the center while others beat on&nbsp; on
      drums.&nbsp; This is was another custom to bring them closer to family,
      friends, and the comfort of their culture.&nbsp; The Native Americans
      Shaman or medicine man was the holy person who had a lot of knowledge and
      power.&nbsp; He healed the sick, told them that their dreams meant, and
      led some dances and ceremonies,&nbsp; He lead the prayers to the Great
      Spirit, decided many of the Indians live decisions, and told the future.</font></b></td>

      for the Plains Indian warrior to win the respect of others and elders by
