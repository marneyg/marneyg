      to African-American soldiers who served the United States in various
      battles and wars following the Civil War.&nbsp; The Buffalo Soldiers
      consisted of former slaves, freemen, and African-American who fought in
      the Civil War.&nbsp; There is more than one theory about why the Indians
      gave them their name .&nbsp; One theory&nbsp; that they were named Buffalo
      Soldiers is because their short curly hair resembled that of a
      buffalo.&nbsp; Another theory is that the name resulted from the heavy
      buffalo robes the soldiers wore.&nbsp; Others say the soldiers strength
      and courage was identical to the buffalo when it was wounded.</font></td>

    After the Civil War, there were many African-American soldiers left without 
    homes or jobs, southerners didn't want to see armed African-Americans near 
    their communities, and African-Americans didn't have many employment 
    opportunities.&nbsp; These are some reasons why the Congress established six 
    all African-American peacetime units: the 9th and 10th Cavalries and the 
    38th , 39th, 40th, and 41st Infantry Regiments.&nbsp; Later, in 1869, the 
    8th and 41st Infantry Regiments consolidated to form the 24th Infantry 
    Regiment.&nbsp; Later, the 39th and 40th Infantry Regiments consolidated to 
    form the 25th Infantry Regiment,&nbsp;&nbsp; There about 1,000 men in each 
    regiment.</font></td>

      The 25th Infantry Regiment was
      organized at Jackson Barracks, Louisiana in April 1868.&nbsp; The 9th
      Cavalry was established in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1866.&nbsp; It was
      commanded by Edward Hatch, and their motto was &quot; We Can: We
      Will.&quot;&nbsp; The 10th Cavalry was formed at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas
      in 1868.&nbsp;It was led by Benjamin Grierson, their motto was &quot; Ready and
      Forward.&quot;&nbsp; African-Americans joined the military because, in
      addition for the chance to serve their country, the army offered shelter,
      educational opportunities, steady pay, medical attention, and a
      pension.&nbsp; Because at the time White men took&nbsp; many of the better
      jobs, the Buffalo Soldiers included many highly educated African-
      Americans who were usually more intelligent and capable than the average
      White soldier.</font></td>

      army and western settlers.&nbsp; They fought off Mexican bandits, cattle
      thieves, and murderers.&nbsp; They helped to move Indian families to reservations,
      and they rode after Indians who tried to leave the reservations.&nbsp; The
      Buffalo Soldiers explored and mapped vast areas of the Southwest and

      The Buffalo Soldiers continued
      to serve in the military after the Indian Wars.&nbsp; In the 1890's,
      following the Indian Wars, the Buffalo Soldiers were sent to Cuba.&nbsp;
      In the 1898 they helped to secure San Juan Hill, fighting alongside future
      President Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders.&nbsp; One eyewitness
      wrote that, &quot;If it had not been for the Negro Cavalry, the Rough
      Riders would have been exterminated.&quot;&nbsp; In 1903 some Buffalo
      Soldiers&nbsp; patrolled national parks in California.&nbsp; The many wars
      and battles Buffalo Soldiers have participated in include Spanish-American Was, the Philippine
      Insurrections, the Mexican Expedition, World War I, World War II, and the
      Korean War.</font></td>

      The Buffalo Soldiers were exposed to harsh discipline,
      tough officers, and poor food and recreational facilities.&nbsp; The only
      bathing facilities usually consisted of a local creeks, so diseases were
      common.&nbsp; In 1866 at Fort Leavenworth, at least one Buffalo Soldier
      died due to disease, mainly cholera, during each month for the first ten
      months of the year.&nbsp; Work was&nbsp; seven days a week except for
      Christmas and the Fourth of July, and pay was only $13 per month.&nbsp;Despite
      there hard conditions, the Buffalo Soldiers excelled.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the years from 1870 to 1880, the
      Buffalo Soldiers wore a dark flannel shirt with light blue trousers, tall
      boots, a blue Civil War hat, and a neckerchief of their choice.&nbsp;
      Although a neckerchief was needed to keep the dust away from their faces,
      the Army would not issue one to the Buffalo Soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

    <font size="5">In addition to being assigned some the worst jobs the Army 
    had to offer, the Buffalo Soldiers endured many more obvious acts of 
    discrimination.&nbsp; Many White officers refused to command the 
    African-American units.&nbsp; The Army and Navy Journal illustrated this: &quot;A 
    First Lieutenant of Infantry (White) stationed at a very desirable post 
    .....&nbsp; Desires a transfer with an officer of the same grade, on equal 
    terms if in white regiment; but if in a colored regiment, a reasonable bonus 
    would be expected.&quot;&nbsp; General George Armstrong Custer was one of the 
    officers who refused to command African-Americans units.&nbsp; However, 
    Buffalo Soldiers ended up saving General Custer and his men when when they 
    were trapped in a battle.&nbsp; The Army supported segregation by providing 
    separate facilities for Buffalo Soldiers and White soldiers.&nbsp; The 
    Buffalo Soldiers helped to build many forts that they were not allowed to 
    use.&nbsp; Buffalo Soldiers were ambushed not only by their enemies, but 
    were also sometimes attacked by the townspeople that they protected.&nbsp; 
    There were many targets for snipers and sometimes became caught up in 
    shootouts just for entering some towns, mostly in Texas.</font></td>

      She joined the army to be near her cousin and a friend who were
      soldiers.&nbsp; She also wanted to earn her own living and not dependent
      upon family or friends.&nbsp; She was 22 years old and five feet, nine
      inches tall when she enlisted.&nbsp; Her name was listed as William
      Cathay.&nbsp; Army documents show that she was hospitalized five times,
      but no one discovered she was a women posing as a man.&nbsp; The St.
      Louis Daily Times article state that she was tired of army life and
      sought a discharge by complaining of pains in her side and knees.&nbsp;
      The doctor examined her, discovered she was a woman, and she was

      Reginald Allen,&nbsp; the first African-American to command a Buffalo Soldier unit.&nbsp;
      Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Allen commented on the important contributions
      of the Buffalo Soldiers in a recent interview.&nbsp; He stated, &quot;The
      incredible thing about the Buffalo Soldiers, especially those who served
      early on, is that they loved this country enough that through the racism,
      through the bigotry, they still wanted to serve.&nbsp; They&nbsp; wanted

      than the best equipment and less than the best provisions at the farthest

      pride and honor and professionalism.&nbsp; That is absolutely no different
