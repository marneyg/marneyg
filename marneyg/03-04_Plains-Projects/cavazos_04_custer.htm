      born in New Rumley, Harrison County Ohio, on Dec. 5 1839. He spent most of
      his childhood with a half-sister in Monroe, Michigan.&nbsp; After he
      enrolled at West Point, where he failed to make himself look good in any
      positive way.&nbsp; Several days after graduating last in his class, he
      failed in his duty as officer of the guard to stop a fight between two
      cadets. He then graduated the U.S. military academy in June of 1861 and
      then went to Washington to work. He was in the First Battle of Manassas.
      His next mission given to him by General Winfield Scott gave him things to
      carry to General Irwin McDowell.&nbsp; After this they put him in command
      of the Army of the Potomac, he was assigned lieutenant in the 5th cavalry.
      On Sept. 30 he began command of the 3rd division of cavalry and fought a
      good battle of Woodstock on Oct. 9. After this he was court-martialed and
      saved from punishment because of the need for officers with the start of
      the Civil War.</font></td>

      fought against his former classmate at West Point the Confederate General
      Rosser. &quot;Let's kick their ass and get the Hell out of here.&quot;
      Custer drove them back 26 miles and he captured everything on wheels
      except one gun. His cavalry units played a critical role in forcing the
      retreat of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's forces; in thanks, General
      Philip Sheridan purchased and made a gift of the Appomattox surrender
      table to Custer and his wife. In a general order addressed to his troops
      at Appomattox Court House, April 9, 1865 General Custer said: &quot;During
      the past six months, though in most instances confronted by superior
      numbers, you have captured from the enemy in open battle 111 pieces of
      field artillery, 65 battle-flags, and upward of 10,000 prisoners of War,
      including seven general officers. Within the past ten days, and included
      in the above, you have captured 46 field-pieces of artillery, and&nbsp; 37
      battle-flags. You have never lost a gun, never lost a color, and never
      been defeated; and notwithstanding the numerous engagements in which you
      have borne a prominent part, including those memorable battles of the
      Shenandoah, you have captured every piece of artillery which the enemy has
      dared to open upon you.&quot; Custer did unexpectedly well in the Civil
      War. He fought in the First Battle of Bull Run and served with panache and
      distinction in the Virginia and Gettysburg campaigns. Although his units
      suffered enormously high casualty rates even if it was the Civil War, his
      fearless aggression in battle earned him the respect of his commanding
      generals and put him in the public eye. He then applied to the government
      for permission to accept from President Juarez the place of chief of
      Mexican cavalry in the struggle against Maximilian. President Johnson
      declined his leave of absence and Custer was appointed
      lieutenant-colonelcy of the 7th cavalry, he then joined his troops at Fort
      Riley. </font></td>

      Riley, Kansas was important in providing protection to the railroad lines
      being built across Kansas. The importance was realized in the summer and
      fall of 1866 when the Union Pacific Railroad reached Fort Riley and the
      7th Cavalry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Andrew J. Smith was grouped at
      the fort. On April 15, 1865 he was appointed the &quot;Brevet&quot; rank
      of Brigadier General of Volunteers. He was also put in command of the 2nd
      Brigade, 3rd Cavalry Division at Gettysburg and Yellow Tavern. He
      commanded the 3rd Cavalry Division in the Shenandoah Valley, Fisher's Hill
      and Five Forks. After the War, Custer had to revert to his old permanent
      rank of Captain. Then he went through the slow promotion process that usually
      happened in the small regular army. That's why Custer was always called
      &quot;General Custer&quot;. In 1867 one of Custer's first official acts
      with the 7th Cavalry was to make a regimental song. He liked &quot;Garry Owen&quot;
      and that's why it was chosen. In March 1867, when Indian attacks became
      more violent, the 7th Cavalry was given its first opportunity to see what
      fighting Indians was all about. Under the command of General Hancock, they
      marched from Fort Riley to Fort Larned. They were joined by 6 infantry
      companies and a battery of artillery creating a task force of over 1400
      men. &quot;There are not enough Indians in the world to defeat the 7th
      Cavalry.&quot; In April 1867, a meeting was held between the Army and a
      few chiefs of the Plains Indians. The Army moved their troops closer to an
      Indians encampment and thought they were being attacked and fled under the
      cover of night.&nbsp;</font></td>

      given the task of tracking the Indians down, he spent the whole summer in
      the attempt to find them. The only contact they made with the Indians were
      with small war parties which wouldn't stop harassing the troops. In this
      campaign, Custer left his command in the field and traveled back to Fort
      Riley to visit his wife. Upon arrival Custer was court-martialed and found
      guilty. He was sentenced to one year suspension from rank and pay. He went
      home to Monroe, Michigan where he waited out his suspension. On Sept. 24
      1868, Custer's court-martial was take off and he went back to his troops
      on Bluff Creek. As soon as he arrived Indians attacked his camp. Custer
      and his troopers gave chase and followed the Indians trail back to Medicine
      Lodge Creek, and found no Indians at all.</font></td>

      were hard hit and supplies destroyed they would have to return to their
      reservations or starve. During winter months the Indians would stay close
      to a good source of water and firewood for heat; they just had to find it.
      Sheridan's plan involved 3 columns: Colonel Andrew W. Evans with six
      troops of the 3rd Cavalry and two companies of the 37th Infantry were to
      go down the South Canadian River. The second column was seven troops of
      the 5th Cavalry under the command of Major Eugene A. Carr. They marched
      southeast from Fort Lyon, Colorado and meet Captain William A. Penrose and
      his column of five troops of cavalry. They stayed at Antelope Hills, along
      the North Fork of the Canadian River. The third column was to march from
      Fort Dodge under the command of General Sully and George A. Custer.
      Sheridan chose the 7th Cavalry and Custer to take the lead. Custer
      followed tracks to the Washita River. It was Chief Black Kettle's village,
      well within the boundaries of the Cheyenne reservation. on the 27th of
      Nov. in 1868, Custer charged and Black couldn't escape. Colonel Andrew W.
      Evans struck another Comanche village at Soldiers Spring on Christmas Day.
      The campaign was successful against the Cheyenne in the Oklahoma
      Territory. </td>

    <td width="100%" height="18" colspan="2">In Feb. 1873 Custer got the good news that the
      7th Cavalry was going to be together and sent north to Fort Rice in the
      Dakota Territory. His mission was to protect settlers in the region and
      the engineers of the Northern Pacific Railroad who were looking at a rail
      route across the Yellowstone River from the Sioux Indians. The completion
      of the railroad link provided an easy way of transportation for gold seekers
      and farmers to come to the area. The Sioux gave the migration problems. On
      June 20 1873, they moved into the Black Hills of Dakota to have protection
      from the railroad constructors. As a point of scouting activities a
      permanent stay was established at Fort Abraham Lincoln south of the Mandan
      from 1873-1876. Custer led his troops into the Black Hills and found gold.
      The government offered to buy the land but the Sioux wouldn't sell it. The
      Army allowed gold prospectors to come into the Reservations hills by the
      thousands. The Sioux left and joined Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse in
      Montana who were resisting white government control.</td>

      scouts leading the way. General Terry was to trap the Indians between
      Custer and Major General John Gibbon in the Little Big Horn Valley. Custer
      had been ordered to move a band of Indians toward the large cavalry force.
      Custer needed to pass all the way down the Rosebud Creek and cross over to
      the Little Big Horn Valley and move north, to prevent the Indians from
      escaping south. After making visual contact with the Indians on June 23,
      Custer ordered the column to turn west toward the Little Big Horn Valley.
      Arikara and Osage scouts identified a party of Sioux following them The
      Sioux fled when approached and Custer didn't want any of the Sioux to
      escape. The night of June 24, Custer told the plan for the next day. When
      they got to the Sioux on June 25 1876, Custer made a decision to attack
      and fight the Indians. On the verge of what seemed to him a certain and
      glorious victory for the U.S. and Custer he ordered an attack on the
      Indian village. &quot;Hurrah boys! We've got them.&quot; Within a short
      period of time, Custer and his troops were annihilated by the full might
      of an estimated 5,000 Sioux Indians who were led by Chief Sitting Bull and
      Chief Crazy Horse.</td>

      1876 at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Custer's mistakes cost him his
      life but gained himself a lot of fame that won't be forgotten. His defeat
      at the Little Big Horn made his life of what would have been a forgotten
      19th&nbsp; century military figure into the talk about in songs, books and
      paintings. His widow Elizabeth B. Custer did what she could to make his
      reputation better. Writings of his life that portrayed him as a military
      genius but a good man. A picture showed Custer like a victim surrounded by
      bloodthirsty savages intent upon his death. Forgotten was that he started
      the battle by attacking the Indian village and that most of the Indians
      present had to surrender within a year of the greatest battlefield achievement.</td>
