      River.&nbsp; Many Sioux children grew up in caring environments. Red Cloud
      was lucky to have that chance.&nbsp; Red Cloud learned how to be a good
      fighter by playing games with other little Sioux boys.&nbsp; Red Cloud had
      a gift for telling stories in an enthusiastic way.&nbsp; His ability of
      speech was just as important as his fighting capabilities. His talent for speech showed signs of being a good leader.&nbsp; He had nine
      siblings, his father was a competent and respected warrior.&nbsp; Red Cloud
      is said to have been good with horses and capable of swimming across the
      Missouri and Yellowstone rivers.&nbsp; Red Cloud had good self-esteem and
      bravery, but he was also polite and kind in everyday situations.&nbsp; He
      also had musical and vocal talent.&nbsp; When Red Cloud was about six, his
      dad presented him with a colt.&nbsp; His dad told him, &quot;My son, when
      you are able to sit quietly upon the back of this colt without saddle or
      bridle, I shall be glad, for the boy who can win a wild creature and learn
      to use it will as a man be able to win and rule men.&quot;&nbsp; Most
      young boys would have went to their grandpa for help.&nbsp; However,
      little Red Cloud did not.&nbsp; He went directly to practice with his
      lariat.&nbsp; Before you knew it, he could lasso the colt.&nbsp; When the
      herd of ponies were taken to get a drink, Red Cloud was there to take his
      colt for a drink, too.&nbsp; Later on, the pony started getting used to Red
      Cloud and allowed himself to be handled.&nbsp; Red Cloud started riding him
      bareback.&nbsp; Many times, Red Cloud was bucked from him.&nbsp; He stuck
      with it until he no longer needed his lariat.&nbsp; His strategy was to
      sit cross-legged and move his body in different ways that guided his
      horse.&nbsp; Red Cloud broke all of his horses, and sometimes his
      father's.&nbsp; When Red Cloud&nbsp; began attending hunting expeditions,
      at nine years of age, he always brought plenty of food home, because of
      his greatly trained horses. At twelve, he actually took part in the
      hunt.&nbsp; Amazed, he discovered his arrows barely punctured the hide of
      the buffalo.&nbsp; With no better idea, he rode his horse up to the buffalo
      and tried to push the arrow deep enough into the buffalo to seriously
      injure it.&nbsp; The furious buffalo moved his head toward Red Cloud and
      knocked him from his horse and the horse form its own feet.&nbsp; Somehow,
      Red Cloud was lucky enough to fall on the other side of the horse than the
      buffalo.&nbsp; The buffalo charged and the horse took all the force.&nbsp;
      The rest of the herd was fleeing, but the very angry buffalo wanted
      revenge and wasn't ready to leave.&nbsp; Red Cloud's father had to come
      rescue him.&nbsp; Red Cloud learned his lesson about going near any angry
      buffalo.&nbsp;</font></b></td>

          <p><b><font face="Batang" color="#800040" size="4">'I was born a Lakota and shall die a
          Lakota.&nbsp; Before the white man came to our country, the Lakotas
          were a free people... As a child I was taught the Taku Wakan
          (Supernatural Powers) were powerful and could do strange things... They
          taught me that I could gain favor by being kind to my people and
          brave before my enemies; by fighting for my people and their hunting
          grounds... Taku Shanshan is familiar with my spirit and when I die I
          will go with him... shadows are long and dark before me.' &quot;</font></b></p>
