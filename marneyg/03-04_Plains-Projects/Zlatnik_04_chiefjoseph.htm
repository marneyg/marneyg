      white settlers and let his people remain in the valley made it appear that
      they might be successful but federal government soon reversed
      itself.&nbsp; In 1877 Oliver Otis Howard threatened A cavalry&nbsp; charge
      to force Joseph's band and other hold-outs onto a small Idaho&nbsp;
      reservation.&nbsp; Believing military resistance futile Joseph led his
      people to the small Idaho reservation.&nbsp; They never made it, About 20
      Nez Perce warriors staged a raid on a nearby settlement and killed several
      whites.&nbsp; Immediately the army led by Howard began to pursue Joseph's

      200 of them warriors fought 2,000 U.S. soldiers in four major
      battles.&nbsp; By October 5th he was known as the &quot;Red Napoleon&quot;

      Military Feat.&nbsp; He wasn't considered a war chief&nbsp; by his people.&nbsp;
      It was decided that the mah rear should meet&nbsp; general Howard's

      planned than the one Chief Joseph set for General Howard.&nbsp; Joseph
      made false trails to mislead them into think that they had crossed the
      Salmon River. Some tents teepee's were pitched in plain site while women
      and children were hidden inaccessible ridges.&nbsp; The Nez Perce&nbsp;

      to head Joseph off, which he undertook at the Montana end of the Lolo
      Trail. There at big hole pass he meet colonel Gibbons with fresh troops.
      Joseph sent a party under his brother Ollicut to Harass Gibbons rear and
      route the pack throwing him on a defensive causing him to send for help
      while Joseph continued his masterly retreat toward Yellowstone park.&nbsp;
      The two forces came together&nbsp; under Howard, even though General Howard
      said the horses were worn out, it was decided to send a detachment of cavalry
      under bacon to Tash Pass the gateway to Yellowstone park, which Joseph
      would have to pass. Bacon had orders to detain him until&nbsp; the rest of
      the cavalry could get there.&nbsp; General Bacon did not have the heart to
