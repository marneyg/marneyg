      introduced to horses, around the year 1700.&nbsp; The only downside to
      hunting the buffalo, was that the Hidatsas, and the Blackfeet-Astinas had
      driven the Shoshone band away from the buffalo.&nbsp; The Shoshone tribe
      had tried to get their land back from their enemies, but that put them at
      risk for an attack, like the one in 1805.</font><font face="Harlow Solid Italic" size="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      Indian woman who led Lewis, recognized Cameahwit as her brother from who

      reunion, the negotiations proceeded and Cameahwit agreed to barter for the
      horses.&nbsp; The Shoshones were most concerned about acquiring guns and
      ammunition in return for the horses.&nbsp; Lewis
