      Were not any railroads.&nbsp; No white settlements nearby. Many miles to
      the closest army post.&nbsp; Native Americans were safe from surprise
      attacks that came from white men.&nbsp; More than 5,000 Native Americans
      from five different tribes went to the meeting.&nbsp; The Kiowa, Comanche,
      Kiowa-Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho all went.&nbsp; There was a lot of
