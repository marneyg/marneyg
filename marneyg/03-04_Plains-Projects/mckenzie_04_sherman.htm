      General Sherman used the same tactics in the west as he did in the Civil
      War. He brought hundreds of foot soldiers and cavalry also with them he
      brought the hell and fire of the Civil War. It was his tactics of attacking
      the Indians economic basis that finally brought an end to the wars on the
      plains.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      Born in Lancaster, Ohio in 1820, Sherman was the son of a State Supreme
      Court judge.&nbsp; Sherman was named after Tecumseh, a Shawnee
      Chief.&nbsp; When Sherman was nine his father died of Typhoid fever.
      Lawyer and family friend Thomas Ewing adopted and raised him. An appointment
      to West Point was secured by Ewing for Sherman. He graduate six in his
      class of forty-two in 1820 after a career as a cadet.&nbsp; He served in
      Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, but the nature of his assignments there
      and during the Mexican-American War disappointed
      Sherman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      Sherman resigned in 1853 to be a banker, then a lawyer, both with very
      little success.&nbsp; Civilian life bored him and he found it unprofitable.&nbsp;
      He applied for, and received the position of superintendent of the
      military academy in Alexandria, Louisiana. A second home to Sherman was
      the south.&nbsp; He knew a painful decision was coming with the
      approaching conflict between the North and The South. Sherman chose to
      join the Union as a colonel&nbsp; even though the Confederates offered him
      a high-ranking position in their new military.&nbsp; Sherman asked the
      President to replace him after the shock and confusion at Bull Run;
      instead of replacing him President Lincoln promoted him to brigadier
      general.&nbsp; This new command brought him lasting fame for the path of
      burning buildings and scorched fields he cut through the South.</font></td>

      The press and Sherman had many conflicts. The press named him &quot;Crazy
      Sherman&quot;.&nbsp; General Henry W. Halleck&nbsp; saved Sherman's
      military career. According to historians, in 1861 Sherman suffered a
      nervous breakdown.&nbsp; Halleck was instrumental in transferring him to
      Missouri for respite.&nbsp; Sherman's wife received&nbsp; a letter from
      Sherman admitting that he had considered suicide.&nbsp; His wife wrote
      Halleck for concern for of her husband; his reply stated: &quot;I will
      willing take all that the newspaper said about Sherman if he will take all
      that they said about me for I am certain to gain by the experience.&quot;</font></td>

      Army turned it's attention west after the Civil War.&nbsp; It's attention
      was on the people who stood in it's way of expansion of the west.&nbsp;
      Sherman spoke fondly of the west and of the frontiersmen who settled it;
      he described the Indians as &quot;a class of savages displaced by the irresistible
      progress of our race. Treachery is inherent in the Indian character.&quot;&nbsp;Sherman
      showed his attitude toward the Indians with these two statements:
      &quot;The more we can kill this year the less will be have to be killed
      the next war. They have to be killed off or maintained as a series of
      paupers.&quot; &quot;All Indians that will not move on to reservations are
      hostile and will remain so until killed off.&quot;</font></td>

      In 1869 Grant appointed Sherman to be the commanding general of the Army,
      in this position he directed a series of campaigns that eventually crushed
      Indian resistance.&nbsp; He used the position to turn opinion into
      action.&nbsp; Sherman only moved the headquarters of the army to St. Louis
      to be farther away from Washington and it's slick politicians.&nbsp;
      Sherman attacked the Indians economic bias once commenting to General
      Sheridan that &quot;it would be wise to invite all of the sportsmen of
      England and America for a Grand Buffalo Hunt.&quot; He attacked in the
      winter when supplies and mobility was limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      Sherman and his escort were bypassed by an Indian war party that had
      received information for an ambushed by an tribal leader. The leader said
      that they must waited for the second group. The violation of the peace
      outraged Sherman. Indians saw the attack as a justice for many wrongs,
      they did not see it as a crime. Sherman's reaction to the Kiowa raid was
      to capture Santanta .&nbsp; They captured him at a parley and tried him
      for murder.&nbsp; He was sentenced him to life imprisonment. He began the
      Red River campaign; by the late 1870's most free roaming tribes were
      forced onto reservations.&nbsp; </font></td>
