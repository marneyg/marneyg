    <td width="100%" height="21" colspan="2">Sitting Bull was born sometime
      between 1831-1834 on the Grand River in what is now known as South Dakota.
      His name when he was little was &quot;Hunkeshnee&quot; which means
      &quot;slow&quot;. He was given this name because he was never in a rush to
      do anything and always did it with care. He killed his first buffalo at
      the age of ten and his first counting coup at the age of fourteen when he
      helped to defend the Hunkpapa hunting grounds. His next encounter was in
      1864 in the battle of Killdeer and then the siege in 1865, which he led
      against the newly established Fort Rice. All of this showed great bravery
      and insight. He became a leader of the Strong Heart warrior society as a
      young man. While in this society he successfully made the Sioux hunting
      grounds bigger. But the U.S. army kept invading the territory and causing
      problems within the tribe and native economy. From 1863-1868 the Sioux
      fought the army's trespasses. Later in his life he became a excellent
      member of the Silent Easter, a group concerned with tribal welfare. In
      1865, Sitting Bull fought against U.S. troops in the Battle of Powder
      River</td>

      boys&nbsp; were enjoying a mimic hunt with calves that had been left
      behind. Then a large calf turned meanly on Sitting Bull, whose pony had
      thrown him. He grabbed both ears of the calf until it was in a buffalo
      wallow or sitting position. The rest of the boys shouted, &quot;He has
      subdued the buffalo into sitting position.&quot; This incident and because
      he showed so much bravery as a young man, his father changed his name to
      &quot;Tatanka-Iyotaka. This name describes a buffalo on its haunches and
      it doesn't move. Also known as Sitting Bull.

      became the Sioux first principal chief. Not long after this peace was made
      with the U.S. government, even though Sitting Bull refused to attend the
      peace conference or sign the treaty. This treaty in known as the Fort
      Laramine treaty which promised the Black Hills would always belong to the
      Sioux. This treaty was broke in 1875 when&nbsp; the government ordered the
      Sioux to reservations because gold was found in the Black Hills. They were
      given a dead line of January 31, 1876 to leave or else the y would be
      considered an enemy. The Indians ignored this warning and in March, Crook
      was ordered to attack them.

      Crooks troops retreat in the battle of the Rose Bud on June 17. To
      celebrate he joined more than 3,000 Indians including the Lakota,
      Cheyenne, and Arapaho in the valley of the Little Bighorn. During this
      time Sitting Bull did a Sun Dance to their Great Spirit, Wanka Tanka.
      During this he slashed his arms 100 times as a sign of sacrifice. Also it
      is believed Sitting Bull received a vision. In this vision he saw where
      the enemies would be brought into his hands and be destroyed and that the
      troops would fall into the Lakota camp like grasshoppers falling from the
      sky. When he woke he told his people of this. He also told them that they
      should fight to kill and he convinced them if they did not change there
      way of fighting they would lose all of their land. There are some of the
      ways that the Battle of the Little Bighorn was won.</td>

      groups and attacked immediately. One was led by Major Marcus Reno, and by
      Captain Frederick Benteen and the other by Custer. They rushed to

      know what you are doing, traveling on this road. You scare all the buffalo
      away. I want to hunt in this place. I want you to turn back from here. If

      as you can.&quot; Mad about the defeat, the military brought thousands to
      the area and over the next year pursed the Lakota to surrender. Sitting
      Bull remained defiant. But in May 1877, Sitting Bull led his people to
      Canada, out of reach of the U.S. army and as a last hope of justice and
      freedom. When General Terry went north to offer Sitting Bull a pardon for settling
      on a reservation, Sitting Bull just sent him away. He said, &quot;If you
      have one honest man in Washington, send him to me and I will talk to

      rights to move back and forth into Canada when he wished and for a
      reservation of his own on the Little Missouri River near the Black Hills.
      Instead, he was sent to Standing Rock Reservation where he rejoined his
      tribe. James McLaughlin was determined to refuse the great chief of any
      special privileges, Sitting Bull was even forced to work in fields. But
      Sitting Bull knew his rights and when a group of U.S. senators came to the
      reservation to talk about opening part of the it to whites, Sitting Bull
      protested forcefully against the plan. He was released to tour with
      Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show in 1885. He earned $50 a week for riding
      once around the the arena plus whatever he could charge for autographs and
      pictures. He only stayed four months. He couldn't stand white society any
      more but he did shake hands with President Grover Clevland, which he took
      as evidence that he was still thought of as&nbsp; a great chief. In 1889
      many&nbsp; natives began a new religion called a Ghost Dance. They
      believed this religion would bring back their land and remove the whites.
      Upon his return sitting Bull had another vision like the one before about
      the battle of the Little Bighorn. In this vision he saw a meadowlark and
      heard it say, &quot;Your own people, Lakota's, will kill you.&quot; Also,
      when he returned he lived in a cabin near where he was born. He refused to
      change his way of life and rejected and lived with two wives which were
      all against reservation rules. Though he didn't like Christianity he sent
      his kids to a nearby Christian school thinking later generation would need
      to read and write. The army was afraid&nbsp; the Ghost Dance would lead to
      an up rise and sought Sitting Bull could possibly be the instigator. They
      went to arrest him on December 15, 1890. The police busted into his cabin,
      drug him outside where his followers were joining to protect him. During
      this a gunfire broke out and a Lakota police man shot Sitting Bull in the
      head. Sitting Bull, his son, and twelve others were killed.
