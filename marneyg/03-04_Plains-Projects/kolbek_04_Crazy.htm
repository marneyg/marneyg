      was untouchable no one could shoot or even hurt him, the warrior he saw in
      his vision was a warrior but he boar no scalps.&nbsp; His first real war
      as a man was when he was 16 years old.&nbsp; He took a wound to the leg by
      a gun, because he had taken 2 scalps.&nbsp; After he came back to his dad
      his dad told him the reason he had got shot in the leg was because he had
