      Apache.&nbsp; It gave them almost everything they needed to live a healthy
      life.&nbsp; Yes, they did farm as well, but buffalo was much more
      important.&nbsp; Something's they couldn't make out of the buffalo, they
      traded with the Pueblos.&nbsp; Another thing, is that since they were
      nomadic, they followed the buffalo a lot. They used the hide for wikinps,
      the bones for weapons and eating utensils, and the meat, they ate and traded
      it to other Indian tribes. </font></blink></td>
