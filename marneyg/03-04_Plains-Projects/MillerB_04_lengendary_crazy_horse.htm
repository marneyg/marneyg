&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1863 he turned twenty-one years old. And the Teton
Sioux chiefs decided to attack the white intruders. &quot;We did not ask you
white men to come here. The Great Spirit gave us this country as a home. You had
yours. We did not interfere with you. The Great Spirit gave us plenty of land to
live on, and buffalo, deer, antelope and other game. But you have come here, you
are taking my land from me, you are killing our game, so it is hard for us to
live. Now, you tell us to work for a living, but the Great Spirit did not make
us to work, but to live by hunting. You white men can work if you want to. We
did not interfere with you, and again you say, why do you not become civilized?
We do not want your civilization! We would live as our fathers did, and their
fathers before them.&quot; Crazy Horse 1865. After Crook was to meet Crazy Horse
