    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 350 followers of Sioux chief Big Foot were camping on the banks of the
    Wounded Knee creek on December 29, 1890.&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. troops were
    told to surround Big Foot and his army.&nbsp;&nbsp; They took away their weapons
    and arrested them.&nbsp;&nbsp; They had trouble and problems
    coming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whites knew something was going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a
    hard time for both Indians and white men.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sioux found their land
    destroys and their life- source gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their lives depended on
    Indian Agents to keep them alive.&nbsp;&nbsp; They tired hard to get back to
    the way things were.&nbsp;&nbsp; They found a new salvation told by Paiute
    Shaman called Wovoka.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Indians were to dance the Ghost Dance to make this happen the dancers wore
      colored light emblazoned images of animals.&nbsp; They thought the &quot;

      In the fall of 1890 the, the dance grew to the Sioux villages of the
      Dakota reservation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
