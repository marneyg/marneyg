      actual golden Eagle head to the entrance of the dance.&nbsp; The Eagle was
      considered the ''Chief'' of all animals in the sky or nest.&nbsp; And a
      very powerful animal in battle. The Eagle is admired for courage,
      Swiftness, and Strength.&nbsp; The Eagle is believed protect the people
      from harm, devastation, or any kind of evil.&nbsp; It is also said that
      the Eagle is the carrier of all messages from Wakan -Tanka (GOD) to the
