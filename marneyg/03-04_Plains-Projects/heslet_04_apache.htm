      women.&nbsp; When ever this women had a baby, a dragon (one of the beasts)
      would eat it to stop the offspring.&nbsp; Once she had a baby boy and hid

      took him hunting and while hunting (with his new bow and arrows) the
      dragon came.&nbsp; The dragon asked for a fight to the death, the boy
      accepted.&nbsp; Each one had a bow and four arrows.&nbsp; They took about
      one hundred steps from each other.&nbsp; The dragon went first by shooting

      The Apache were made up of bands.&nbsp; A band is three or more big families
      joined together; this formed a band.&nbsp; Band members would chose a
      leader.&nbsp; The band leaders would then chose a tribe leader, but there
      was never any leader higher than that in power.&nbsp; Over about a whopping
      twenty- two band belonged to the Apache back then, but some aren't band
      anymore, now days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

      The Apache lived in small housing.&nbsp; These small houses were made of ether

      houses were commonly call wikinps.&nbsp; They were also called many other
      names, but most tribes used the same design as the Apache, because they
      copied them, and found it did really well for their houses.</font></p>

      During ceremonies, males painted their bodies, dressed in kilts, blacks
      masks, tall wooden headdresses, and carried wooden swords.&nbsp; They did
      this to imitate the Gans, or Mountain Spirits.&nbsp; They did a dance (in
      their costumes) to salute the Gans.&nbsp; They also did many other things,
      that were very similar to other tribes.&nbsp; During the Ghost Dance
      phase, they still kept with this religion.</font></p>

      The many&nbsp;enemies that the Apache had was one of their biggest
      problems.&nbsp; The Pueblos are sort of an enemy and an ally.&nbsp; This
      is because they traded with them for food and animal skins, but they also
      did other bad things, like raiding them.&nbsp; Actually, the Apache were
      feared by many other tribes.&nbsp; One U.S. general, George Crook, called
      them: &quot;Tigers of the human species.&quot;&nbsp; They raided tribes
      because, they were becoming poor with their resources.&nbsp; They were
      never in many big wars (aside from the Indian Wars), but it is fascinating
      to learn how the Indian boys became warriors.&nbsp; Click <a href="heslet_04_warriorboys-link.htm">here</a>

      Now days, the Apache are successful business people.&nbsp; They own many business,
      like the highly popular Sunrise Park Ski Resort. and the Fort Apache
      Timber Company.&nbsp; Many Apache do other things, like lawyers and
      doctors.&nbsp; Some Apache still are rich in tradition.&nbsp; A lot of
      Apache were wiped out during the 1900's, but the Apache are still standing
