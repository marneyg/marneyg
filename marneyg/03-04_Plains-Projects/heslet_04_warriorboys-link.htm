            All Apache <font size="3">boys , starting at around age 7, had to
            become warriors.&nbsp; Every morning, a boy would go wash in the
            river (even if was freezing clod; they'd break the ice and bathe</font></font><font size="3" color="#CC3300" face="Kristen ITC">.)
            To toughen up, the boys would play wrestling games, and the would
            also mock battles too.&nbsp; When the boy thought he was ready
            (around age 12) he would have to do four raids to become a
            warrior.&nbsp; First, a shaman would give the boy 3 items, a scratchier
            (to scratch him), a drinking tube (to make sure water didn't touch
            his lips), and a special war cup.&nbsp; He was then scared to show
            the Gans that he is becoming a warrior.&nbsp; Then, he'd go on the
            raids. If he did well on the first raid, he would be invited back.
            Once he finished the four raids, he was considered a warrior.</font></font></td>
