      The
      Ghost Dance is a dance that Indians do in hopes to bring back their dead
      ancestors. Big Foot band Which consisted of&nbsp; women that lost their
      husband or male relative&nbsp; n battle with Custer, Miles, and Crook.
      They would dance until they collapsed to hope that it would bring back the
      dead warriors. Sitting Bull doubled that they would come back from the
      dead. Kicking Bear assured them that if they the white shirts with magic
      symbols that the bullets wouldn't hurt them. Sitting Bull consented it
      which thus lead to the death of&nbsp; Kicking Bear on December 15. As the
      number of people involved in the Ghost&nbsp; Dance Movement increased the
      panic&nbsp; and hysteria of the Indian agents increased with it .
      McLauglin Telegraphed Washington to ask him for troops and blaming Sitting
      Bull as the power behind this &quot;pernicious system of religion.&quot;
      &quot;The coming of the troops has frightened the Indians. If the Seventh-
      Day Adventists prepare the ascension robes for the second coming of the
      savior the United States Army is not put in motion to prevent them. Why
      shouldn't the indians have the same privilege? IOf the troops remain ,
      trouble is sure to come.&quot; On December 12, they recieved the order to
      arrest Sitting Bull. The Indian&nbsp; police surrounded sitting bulls
      cabin before dawn. When they entered the cabin he agreed to go with them
      and wanted his horse saddled. While he was dressing a group of&nbsp;
      ghos5t dancers came to challenge the group. Lieutenant Bull Head was shot
      in the side and when he tried to shoot back he shot Sitting Bull. Then
      another policeman shot Sitting Bull in the head . Many Indian policeman
      died that day before the calvery arrived to quit the fighting. </font></td>

    <td width="100%" colspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ghost Dance was an attempt of
      a group of North American Indian Tribes to further seperate themselves from
      the white man and the religious doctrines they were forcing uponthe tribal
      peoples. The despair and nostalgia associated with the Ghost Dance
      reflectsthat period from which this movement evolved. These plains tribes
      faced losing thier freedom and being overtaken of their homes, their
      beliefs, and their existence. This Ghost Dance is a ressurection of the
      dead a bringing back of the customs and way of life that the indians were
      trying to hold onto. The prophet began the movement of Ghost Dance was
      Wovoka . He was known as the medicine man, he was said during an eclipse
      of the sun and white suffering an high fever. Wovoka had a vision which
      inspired the development of the movement known as the ghost dance. The
      ghost dance was different from others cause it consisted of fast steps a
      loud drumming. It had slow shuffling movements following the path of the
      sun. It was performed for four or five days with singing and chanting but
      not drumming. In addition men and women both participated in the dance.
      Men were the main dancers, singers, and musicians. The first dance was
      held by Wovoka in 1889. The plains tribes also adopted the Ghost Dance
      movement also the peaceful message of hope was spreading and uplifting
      many Indians. Sitting Bull adopted the Ghost Dance into his way of life.
      He was a respected leader, medicine man, and warrior ,and a famous Sioux
      warrior. The Ghost Dance continued to be danced in more Southern tribes,
      but the end of the movement really came with the death of&nbsp; Wounded
      Knee. These hopes of the Indian also ended at the massacre.

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kavanagh located 78 ghost Dance Images. which
      were all taken among the Southern Arapho of Oklahoma . Mooney arrived in
      Indian territory in December 1890 ; By the time he was in Darlington
      Agency Headquarters of the Cheyennes and Arapahos&nbsp; towards the end of
      the month,&nbsp; &quot; The ground was covered deeply in snow, which
      stopped the dancing for several weeks.&quot; The rehearsals were held in
      the tipi of Black Coyote almost every night until all the snow melted .
      Then &quot; When all the snow melted, the dancers were renewed.&quot;
      Mooney wrote the Henry Henshaw on January 27, a tuesday and said&quot;
      Sunday{ i.e. two days previous the 25th} [I] counted at one time 139
      dancers, besides outside spectators with 26 others inside the circle .
      some in a manic frenzy, some in spasms , and others&nbsp; stretched out on
      the ground stiff an unconcious.&quot; (Monney to Hnshaw, 27 Jan 1891). </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tavibo, used his fathers teachings and his own
      vision during an eclipse of the sun. He began to spread &quot;gospel&quot;
      that had come to be known as the ghost dance religion. Tavibo told people
      that hte earth would soon perish and hten come alive again in a pure,
      abdoriginal state. for them to earn this new raku=ity they had to live
      harmoniously, and honestly , cleanse themselves very often, and also shun
      the way the white did, especially alcohol, the destroyer. Wovoka
      discouraged the practice of mourning, because the dead would soon be
      resurrected, demanding instead the performance prayers, meditation,
      chanting, and especiallly dancing through which might briefly die and
      catch a glimpse of the paradise to come. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three hundred tents were placed in a circle,
      with a tree in the center. It was covered with strips of various colors
      like eagle feathers, stuffed birds, claws, and horns all offerings to the
      Great Spirit. Their shirts for the men was made of the same material
      shirts and legging painted in red. Some of the legging were painted in
      strips running up and down and some others running around the necks, and
      the whole garmet was fantastically sprinkled with figures of birds, bows
      and arrows, sun and stars, and&nbsp; everything they saw in nature. On the
      outside of the sleeve was rows of feathers tied up the quill ends and left
      to fly in the breeze, and also a ring around the neck and up and down the
      outside of the leggings. After the master spoke for fifteen minutes three
      of four hundred people arose. One&nbsp; of them stood directly beside
      another each with their hand on their neighbors shoulder. After they
      walked about 5 times chanting &quot;Father , I come,&quot; they stopped
      marching. But they remained in the circle and set up the most fearful,
      heart- piercing ails I ever heard- crying, moaning, groaning, and
      shrieking out their grief. When the people arose again, they enlarged the
      circle by facing towards the center the hold of hands, and moving around
      in the manner of school children in their play &quot;needle's eye.&quot;
      And now the most intense excitement began. The people would as fast as
      they could, with their hands moving from side to side, their bodies
      swaying. If one, more weak and frail, came near falling, he would be
      jerked up and positioned until tired nature gave away. From the beginning
      they chanted, They chanted to monotonous tune, the words were. Father, I
      come; Mother, I come; Brother, I come; Father gives us back our arrows.
      They would repeat over ond over again until first one and then anyone
      woild break from the ring and stagger away and fall down. The people kept
      up dancing until fully 100 people were lying unconcious then they stopped
      and seated themselves in a circle, and as each recovered from his trait
      was brought to the center of the ring to relate his experience. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As according to Wovoka, converts of the new
      religion were suppose to take part in the ghost dance to hassten the
      arrival of&nbsp; the newera as promised by the mession. Even though the
      Bureau of Indian affairs banned the ghost dance as they did all other
      Indians spiritual rituals. The Lakotas adopted it and began composing
      sacred songs of hope: The whole world is coming, a nation is coming, a
      nation is coming, the eagle has brought them message to the tribe. The
      father says so , the father says so over the whole earth they are coming ,
      The buffalo are coming, the buffalo are coming , the crow has brought the
      message to the tribe, The father says so, the father says so. The ghost
      dance religion promised an apocalypse in the coming years during which
      time the earth would be destroted, only to be recreated with the Indians
      as the inheritors of the new earth. The ghost dance finally ended.</p>
