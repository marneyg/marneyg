      time for sure.&nbsp; As you will read you will learn about the destruction
      of the Plains Buffalo. The white hunters would just shoot the buffalo just
      for fun.&nbsp; The railroad was another way for the hunters to get the
      buffalo.&nbsp; The railroad also helped the traders and hunters ship
      buffalo hides and meat to factories and family.&nbsp; The Indians used
      every part ion the body, the don't waste on thing.</td>

    <td width="100%" colspan="2">The amount of bison in North America in the early part of
      the 19th Century was incredible.&nbsp; They had an estimate range of about
      30 to 200 million with 60 million being the best estimate.&nbsp; They were
      found as far east from the Yukon to Florida.&nbsp; The destruction was the
      most awful and brutal massacre in it's time.&nbsp; In the beginning of the
      last decade of the buffalo, the Indians made an effort from wanton
      destruction.&nbsp; In June 1874, the Senate passed a bill for the
      protection of the buffalo, but the bill failed to receive the Presidents
      signature.&nbsp; By the time the bill was not signed by the President to
      not shoot the buffalo, the southern herd was represented by bones, while
      the northern herd was in with years of it's extinction.&nbsp; During this
      enterprise time period the slaughter was world wide.&nbsp; These
      individuals invariably killed five times as many animals as could be
      utilized, and cutting from each animal only the parts the shooter wants
      {the tongue, hind quarters, and the hump}.&nbsp; The slaughter was a
      sentiment which fostered our desire further to oppress, to bring under
      subjection and to rob of their birthright.

      the most
      populated countries impacted significantly on the buffalo.&nbsp; The
      Railroad allowed easy access to the buffalo by anyone who wanted to shoot
      and they did, right from the trains.&nbsp; The settlers that shot the
      buffalo form trains were backed up by an unlimited supply of new accurate breech-loading rifles and plenty of ammo.&nbsp; A wild rush of white
      buffalo hunters came to buffalo countries.&nbsp; In June 1872 over 2
      million were just killed just for their hides.&nbsp; There is an estimate
      of 31 million were slaughtered bye 1868 and 1881.&nbsp; The majority of
      the white buffalo hunters killed for the tongues and hides leaving the
      carcasses on the Plains to rot.&nbsp; The buffalo tongue was the main meat
      that the hunters kept.&nbsp; The tongues were purchased at 25 cents each
      and sold in the markets and sold in the markets farthest east at 50 cents.</td>

      He killed over 3500 bison is 35 days.&nbsp; By the time the buffalo country

      conflict grew between two&nbsp; parties.&nbsp; The US Army was
      having quite a time controlling the Indians.&nbsp; Grant vetoed the bill causing
      the hunters and Sheridan to kill more buffalo.&nbsp; By 1885, less
      than 500 buffalo survived.&nbsp; Finally, President Cleveland signed the
      bill to protect the buffalo.&nbsp; &quot;We slaughtered the buffalo in

      staggering amounts of hides back east to tanners.&nbsp; They would stop
      the train and just cut the fur off the buffalo that they shot and leave
      the other part of the body to rot.&nbsp; The prices for the buffalo were
      good.&nbsp; Fifty cents for a young buffalo and 1.25&nbsp; for an
      adult.&nbsp; Most of the British Army goods were made from buffalo leather
      exclusively for twenty years.&nbsp; At the time, there had been a
      decimation of Argentine cattle herds, which supplied most of the major
      leather markets until 1870.&nbsp; In 1870, Josiah Wright Mooar sent some
      bison hides to his brother in New York, who sold them in a tannery.&nbsp;
      Satisfied with the out come of a new tanning process, the tannery ordered
      2000 more for $3.00 each.&nbsp; Buffalo robes became a fashion statement

      Plains Indians until the white mans goods first eliminated and then replaced
      the animal.&nbsp; The buffalo meant a lot of thing to all the
      Native Americans.&nbsp; They were food and clothing, tools and utensils,
      and most of all a spirit blessing the people with every thing they need to
      survive.&nbsp; The Indians used every part of the body.&nbsp; They use the
      dung for fire wood and the rough side of the tongue for a hair brush.&nbsp; The brains were used for tanning agents.&nbsp; The bones were
      turned into handles for knives.&nbsp; On other hand the white hunters
      would shoot the buffalo and let them lay.&nbsp; The 200,000 Native
      Americans Plains Indians were thought to kill 2 million buffalo a year a
      mere third of the bison's birthrate.&nbsp; A major part of Indian life was
      oriented around the buffalo herds.&nbsp; They traveled with the buffalo
      all but the winter months.&nbsp; The bison was the first wild species to
      be extinct before the advance of civilization.</td>
