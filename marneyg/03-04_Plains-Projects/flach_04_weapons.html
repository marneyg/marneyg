    are very interesting to a lot of people that like to learn about it. Here 
    are a couple of weapons they had to use. Knives, bows and arrows, tomahawks, 
    gunstock war clubs, and guns. When the Europeans came they found the Native 
    Americans. The Native Americans thought the Europeans had nice weapons like 
    the following: steel knives, swords, fire-belching arquebus and cannons. The Fur Trade had brought lots
      of weapons for the Indians and the U.S.&nbsp;</font></td>

    <td width="100%" colspan="2"><font size="4">You would be amazed to learn 
    about knives. In any primitive living situation the most important and 
    sough-after tool is the knife. In early life they used the knife about 
    everyday. With a knife you could do the following: put up a dwelling, mend 
    moccasins, clothing, make arrows, skin animals, clean fish, build traps, 
    scrape hides, take scalps, and many more. The knife had never left an Indian 
    man. It would be sheathed at his side or around his neck. It would always be 
    ready in a fight. The hold of the knife was made by a leather or rawhide 
    sheath and sometimes with a wooden out liner. Small knives were held around 
    the neck while big knives were held by belt around your waist. Sometimes old 
    swords that were worn down would be cut down and used as a knife. The blade 
    of a knife would be made from a worn down file. A kitchen knife that had 
    been used for a while might receive a new bone handle. Thousands of blades 
    and finished knives from Europe came from the fur trade. A plain knife just 
    like the butcher and wood-handle &quot;scalpers&quot; found with the Plains Indians.</font></td>

      Weapons were used for many things like hunting for game and war. Indians
      would mostly used bows and arrows for hunting game when the U.S. would use
      their guns. In the early life people were using stone points. But now they
      have thought of bows and arrows . Indians did not just use bows and arrows
      they would also use guns, but bows and arrows were the most important to
      them. Bows and arrows were not just used for wars they were used for
      hunting game and a gift from the creator. A doctor named J.H. Bill had
      discovered how the Hopi Indians would put poison on the arrows. By using
      the livers that rotted and the poison from snakes. When arrows were done
      they would dip them in plant, and venom poisons. The Indians would put
      this stuff on the arrows. The tendons after fitting it on the arrows shaft.
      It would make there body swell up. Removing arrowheads were always hard to
      get out of the body for a while. The doctor would have to wiggle it out of
      the body. The wood part of the arrows were made of a branch of a willow
      tree and spears were made of stone. Arrows were not as heavy as spears
      were. So then they could carry a lot more of them. They used lots of
      things to make arrows. Here are the following: shipped stone (flint, obsidian,
      and more), bones shells, metal, and wood. The Indians always had bows and
      arrows. They would never run out of them when they went to war.</font></td>

      The most ubiquitous symbol was associated with all Native Americans is the
      tomahawk. However,&nbsp; not very many people were aware of the multiformity of its history. The term &quot;tomahawk&quot; is the definition
      of the Algonquian word &quot;Tomahak&quot; or &quot;Tamahakan.&quot; The
      definitions of those words would be called to stone0headed implements used
      as weapons and tools in the early 1600's. The tomahawk does not weight
      that much. It would only weight around one pound or less. Tomahawks were
      made by a Indian blacksmith. At the opposite head of the tomahawk was a
      place for a spiky hammer poll, or&nbsp;most ingeniously, a pipe bowl. The 
    pipe tomahawk became the most popular &quot;hawk&quot; of all of them. It was the </font></td>

    a hollows handle. Many Native Americans used the tomahawks for a weapon. 
    They would use it as a hand weapon and it would act like a missile. Most of 
    the tomahawks made in the early day was made by a sharpened stone that was 
    tied to a wooden handle. They had different&nbsp; kinds of tomahawks like a 
    tomahawk used for ceremonially purpose. It would have like paint and feat

    history, but here is some about it. The gunstock war club was used by both 
    Plains and Woodland regions. The word &quot;gunstock&quot;, which is disputed by some, 
    refer to its shape. To the mans long arm, which is a symbol of&nbsp; great 
    powers. This weapon could be held with one or two hands. A heavy blow could 
    be from the bladed side. You could also swing its point first so you could

      <font size="4">Guns I would say were the most important and used by a lot.
      Firearms were brought to America by the explores that first came. Then
      they fell into the hand of Indians. The recorded use of the firearms was
      in June of 1609. In the Little Bighorn the Americans only used guns. Right
      before they left for battle they gave up the swords. With Indians using
      repeating rifles and U.S. using single shot. The Indians had more of an advantage
      to win. The Indians were using a Spencer Carbine that could shoot about
      seven rounds before they had to reload the guns. While every time the U.S.
      shot they had to keep reloading. Indians also used a Winchester or a Henry
      rifle. A 44 Caliber that could hold up to about 16 rounds of ammunition
      before reloading. They called the guns many name. French people called it
      Fuke, Furil, and Fusee. And makers would call it Carolina Musket.</font></td>
