      weapons.&nbsp; The United States used everything from a Colt pistol to a
      Gatling gun.&nbsp; The U.S. had great fire power, but the Indians had
      something different.&nbsp; They had bows and arrows and many types of war
      clubs.&nbsp; They were skilled with their weapons and as deadly as if they
      were using guns.&nbsp; There was one weapon that both the United States
      and the Indians used.&nbsp; This weapon was the Henry was the Henry
      repeating rifle.&nbsp; This was a very amazing and very successful
      gun.&nbsp; Many weapons were used in the Indian Wars and they were all

      Spencer, the Sharps carbine, and the Springfield single shot .50 caliber
      rifle. The infantry used the .45 Springfield in 1873 and the cavalry used
      the same caliber, but with a shorter carbine.&nbsp; The Springfield .45
      and .50 cal. were&nbsp; single shot. The .45 was effective at 400
      yards.&nbsp; With a velocity of 1200 fps, it will fly about 1000 yards.</td>

      The United States used the single shot for a reason. The had two very good
      reasons for staying with what they used.&nbsp; The first reason they chose
      single shots was because the soldier would waste ammo with repeaters and
      the Army just didn't have the money to do this. Reason number two was that
      they thought plain and simple that the Springfield was a better gun. At
      long ranges the Springfield .45 had great accuracy. The U.S. held accuracy
      higher than filling the sky with bullets for the type of fighting they
      did.</td>

      Gatling gun had never been used west of the Mississippi River in combat
      until the Red River War. A 10-pounder Parrott rifle was used, which wasn't
      a rifle at all but a small cannon. With a range of 2000 yards, a shell
      nearly 9 inches long, and 3 inches in diameter this was a powerful weapon.
      A short barreled mountain howitzer was also used.</td>

      Arrows could accurately be shot at 100 yards.&nbsp; Comanches had guns
      from the middle 1700s onward, but used bows and arrows also because they
      were good for ambushes.&nbsp; Author Richard Perry wrote in 1868 that
      &quot; The bow and arrow in the hands of skillful warriors proves very
      deadly...best weapon that can be used in the chase...can be worn without
      the slightest sense of encumbrance...they can always be relied
      on...&quot;&nbsp; You would always have the resources to make bows and
      arrows.&nbsp; Arrowheads could be made out of anything sharp and
      everything else was made out of wood.&nbsp; Some Indians dipped arrows
      tips in poison, but it was useless since the arrows were already
      deadly.&nbsp; Half of the Indian warrior used bows and arrows in the
      Battle of the little Bighorn.&nbsp; Their tactic was to shoot indirectly
      and the enemy wouldn't know where they were.</td>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Although arrows were deadly, some people did live to see another
day. An unknown person was hit with a Comanche arrow.&nbsp; A verbal report said,&quot;
The weapon pierced the upper part of the right point protruding at the back
between the scapula and the spine. A silk handkerchief was fastened to the
shaft, which was pushed through his body...&quot;&nbsp; He healed and was on
active duty for many more years.&nbsp; Private John Krumholz was hit with an an
arrow in his left eye. The arrow was about two inches into his head.&nbsp; It
was removed and four days later he returned to active duty. Bows and arrows
didn't rule the West, but they were a big part. Arrows were deadly, still the
soldiers had a chance to live.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Bows and arrows weren't the only weapons the Indians used. Indians
used hand weapons, too.&nbsp; Indians made knives from sharp pieces of bone.
Traders traded Indians steel knives. All Indians wanted wanted &quot;trade&quot;
knives. A lot of Indians got their steel knives from fur traders. They used their
knives for everything. They used them for scalping, cleaning animal, and
anything you can think of.&nbsp; Tomahawks came around in the early 1600s. It
weighed about one pound. Indians made them, but Europe also mass-produced
tomahawks. They had a spike on the back or a pipe to smoke.&nbsp; Indians used
many war clubs.&nbsp; The jawbone war club was mostly used in the plains. They
used pieces of animal jawbone to make them.&nbsp; They were used on
horseback.&nbsp; The gunstock war club was used in the Woodland and Plains
regions. It wasn't a real gun stock, it was just the shape of one.&nbsp; It was
a symbol of power.&nbsp; It had a blade sticking out on one side.&nbsp; The ball
headed club was used in the Woodland area. It was made out of one piece of
hardwood.&nbsp; The ball at the end was 3 to 5 inches.&nbsp; The first club
appeared in the early 1600s.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the United States Army and the Indians had very different
weapons, they both used one. This one weapon was the Henry repeating
rifle.&nbsp; The Rebels called the .44 cal. Henry &quot;that damned Yankee rifle
that can be loaded on Sunday and fired all week.&quot;&nbsp; In 1854 the
lever-action Volcanic rifle was introduced. The lever-action was a good idea,
but the gun was a failure. The ammunition was not consistent. The projectile was
lead. A cavity in the lead is where the powder was.&nbsp; A perforated cork disc
seated the powder. The ammo was the cause of it failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Tyler Henry of the New Haven Arms Company used the same idea,
but used a rimfire bullet.&nbsp; It held sixteen rounds.&nbsp; It was designed
in 1857 and patented in October 1860.&nbsp; The Henry was popular, but the
government only bought 1731 of them and mostly bought by soldiers that were
discharged but couldn't part with their guns. In 1865 the Civil War was over and
Spencer's became cheap, but people preferred the Henry even if it cost
seventy-five dollars. The Henry helped many people survive in the Plains.&nbsp;
George Ray of a train of 25 wagons went hunting.&nbsp; Indians surround him. He
fought the band off with his Henry and made it back to his train.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; In June 1865, Albert J. Fountain and Corporal Val Sanchez were on
the trail of some raiding Navahos in New Mexico near the Rio Grande. The Indians
turned and came after them.&nbsp; Fountain and Sanchez headed into a mountain
pass that went to Fort McRae. They thought they lost the Indians but were afraid
of an ambush. Fountain told Sanchez to go a different way. Then his horse was
killed when it was hit with a bullet.&nbsp; Fountain was stuck under his
horse.&nbsp; He was shot with an arrow in his left shoulder and right
forearm.&nbsp; A bullet hit him in his left thigh.&nbsp; With his Henry he
killed ten Indians and scared the others away.&nbsp; Help came the next day.

buffalo, as well as other game, defend myself in encounters with hostile
Indians.&quot;&nbsp; Kelly was to carry mail between Fort Berthold and Fort
Stevenson.&nbsp; On one trip, two Sioux came upon him.&nbsp; One with a shotgun
and one with a bow. They started shooting from thirty yards. Kelly popped the
one with a shotgun quick.&nbsp; The other hid behind a tree, but Kelly got him

&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indians liked Henrys, too.&nbsp; Some friendly looking Sioux
entered the camp of some young wood yard workers in 1868 and asked to look at
their Henry. The Indians killed the owners with their own guns.&nbsp; Many post
traders were selling Henrys and ammo to Indians as early as 1869. The government
tried to stop them, but couldn't.&nbsp; The .44 cal. bullet was not made to be
made to be reloaded.&nbsp; The Indians did and we know this because they still
used rim fire after center fire came out.&nbsp; The Indians used the Henry for
20 years. It was last used in the mid-1880s. Many weapons were used in the war
between the United States and the Native Indians and they all were a big part of
it.
