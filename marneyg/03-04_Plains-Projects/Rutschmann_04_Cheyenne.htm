      started nearly six-hundred years ago.&nbsp; They weren't always a plains
      tribe.&nbsp; They originally were a woodland tribe.&nbsp; They lived in
      the Great lakes region and were farmers and lived in earth lodges.&nbsp;
      They latter began moving west and slowly began becoming nomads.&nbsp; They
      quickly learned the uses of horses.&nbsp;</td>

      western most tribes of the Algonquian family.&nbsp; The word Cheyenne
      means, alien language.&nbsp; They split into two groups the northern and
      southern Cheyenne.&nbsp; Relations continued but inevitably the
      intervention of white people made this impossible.&nbsp;</td>

      religions.&nbsp; I'm only going to mention a few.&nbsp; The Cheyenne had
      at one time a belief given to them by the medicine man, sweet
      medicine.&nbsp; It was that there were arrows that would make them indestructible.
      It was suppose to return their power to them but if they are broken then
      they will cease to exist spiritually and as tribe.&nbsp; Part of the
      ritual was that only men may view the arrows to keep them powerful the Cheyenne
      had to act accordingly, responsibly, and not abuse the power. Oh yeah
      required the participation.&nbsp; Another very important part of the
      ritual is a symbolic peeled willow stick.&nbsp; Each family had one to represent
      them this was placed in side a double tipi called the renewal lodge where
      the bundle was opened and the arrows redone.&nbsp; Another very
      important part in Cheyenne religion was the usage of sacred earths.&nbsp;
      Two small patches of cleared soil on opposite sides of the renewal lodge
      one representing the Cheyenne diminishing drawing power in on it's
      self.&nbsp; While the other represented Shwatio increasing in power in power as
      energy was released from the center.</td>

      called the sun dance ritual a dancer in summer would dance for days
      without food or water often sometimes there was a special lodge built around
      a central pole. The dancer may often hang his body from the sticks with
      raw hide or instead the pole might have animal skulls used and dance until
      his skin burst from the sticks.&nbsp; This ritual was is often performed
      so that one gain favor in the spirit world.</td>

      I meant three.&nbsp; One type of religion was the tree burial were a close
      relative&nbsp; of the deceased would put the deceased in good clothes and
      was painted and put in a tree as a burial.&nbsp; If in a treeless area
      then a scaffold was made and supported on four upright poles.&nbsp; The
      people&nbsp;the people would often mourn for about a year.&nbsp; To show sorrow
      they might scar them selves or a loved one might moan on grave sights,
      although they believed spots so haunted not even enemy tribes would dare defile
      such a sight for fear of spiritual vengeance.</td>

      up.&nbsp; The treaty set up tribal boundaries as well as states that land
      is theirs for every and says they will receive money as well as as military
      aid.&nbsp; The Indians signed it aside from a few small gangs that

      14, 1865 the southern Cheyenne tribe signed a treaty stating they cede all
      of their land unto the u.s. government&nbsp;and most of the Colorado
      teritority.&nbsp; Due to the medicine lodge treaty saying they move onto
      smaller reservation in Indian territory. The United States Government
      ignored their side of the treaty.&nbsp; This caused more Indians to join
      roman nose.&nbsp; In 1861the southern Cheyenne signed a treaty giving up
      all their land except their sand creek reservation which was about two
      hundred miles away from the nearest buffalo herd.&nbsp;</td>

      settlement in 1861-1864 after the of gold in the pikes peak region of Colorado
      between 250-400 Indians were killed on November 29, 1864.&nbsp; Black
      Kettle rose an American flag and a white flag as symbols of peace the Cheyenne
      were involved in a battle called the sand creek massacre in which Black
      Kettle was killed a group of Cheyenne who were under government protection
      were camped on sand creek were were slattered by the third Colorado volunteers
      under command by colonel John chivington well they were attacked
      on their land and military personal researched the slatter though action
      was not taken&nbsp;to pay it back so the Cheyenne began raiding and
      obliterating Colorado cattle for food the Colorado militia attacked Indian
      groups because of this well of course the first group they attacked
      had nothing to do with this. This caused anger and so black kettle went to
      see the army. The army agreed to peace terms on that they return to sand
      creek so they can be at peace.&nbsp; This caused military action against
      them which led to the Medicine Lodge treaty. November 12, ove4r 100men
      and women and children were killed including black kettle. When the
      attacked village came out to see what the problem was they were
      killed.&nbsp; Custer decided to attack the Cheyenne in winter his soldiers
      followed a group onto the Washitia river they attacked a village with
      nothing to do with the raids.&nbsp; Thanks to this a small band followed
      along with Roman Nose and began to wander their former lands. Black Kettle
      and surviving Cheyenne a treaty for better Kansas territory.</td>
