      were invented the Indians hunted the buffalo by foot.&nbsp; When they got
      more creative they used spears and bows and arrows for the hunt.&nbsp; The
      &quot;Buffalo Pound&quot; and &quot;Buffalo Jump&quot; were was to kill
      large numbers of buffalo.&nbsp; Buffalo Pound method- The buffalo
      were lead in to an area where other hunters would be waiting to attack
      them with spears.&nbsp;<b>  </b> Buffalo Jump- The &quot;chasers&quot; or
      &quot;runners&quot; would lead the animals toward a cliff where the other
      hunters waited behind rocks and trees.&nbsp; When they were doing this
      other people would be waving blankets and shouted forcing the animals over
      the edge of the cliff.&nbsp; The hunters at the bottom would be waiting
      for the buffalo to jump.&nbsp; When they did this the Indians would kill
      the crippled buffalo.</font></td>

      and waited for the best time to kill.&nbsp; Hunting parties would also
      drive the buffalo in to deep snow and kill them there.&nbsp; Others drove
      the buffalos in to large bodies of water where the buffalo were unable to
      get away. <b>Chase method</b>-The chase method was used if the Indians had
      horses.&nbsp; They would chase the buffalo and try to get as close as they
      could and they then would shoot them with a gun or a bow and arrow. In
      summers bands of hunters would get together and hunt.&nbsp; This killed
      way more buffalo and they got more meat.&nbsp; When they had horses and
      guns it was way more easy for the people to kill the buffalo.&nbsp; As
      more people came to the Plains more buffalo disappeared.&nbsp; By 1880 the
      huge herds of buffalo had disappeared.&nbsp; Bison had become the most
      hunted animal on the Plains.</font></td>

      <p> <font face="Elephant"> The origin of the sun dance is traced
      to the buffalo.&nbsp; Before the dancing began, a sacred sun dance pipe
      was filled and sealed with fat from a buffalo's heart.&nbsp; Laubin said
      that the Sioux dance leader threw himself prone on the ground, west of the
      scared buffalo skull. As a major animal represented in sun dance, it has
      both&nbsp; spiritual and physical ties to human kind.&nbsp; For Plains Indianans
      today the buffalo retains its symbol importance.&nbsp; Many tribal leaders
      are trying to bring back the buffalo.<b> </b>How the Indians used the
      Buffalo- The Indians used every part of the buffalo.&nbsp; They never wasted&nbsp;
      any part of it.&nbsp; The most useful part of the buffalo is the
      hide.&nbsp; The thickness and the uses varied by the age and the sex of
      the buffalo.&nbsp; Thinnest was that of unborn calves for berry
      bags.&nbsp; The Indians treated the skins to give them different things
      the needed.&nbsp; Rawhide was tough and stiff&nbsp; in texture.&nbsp; For
      winter garments and blankets the hair was left on the hide.&nbsp; Other
      used hide were scraped clean.&nbsp; Sometimes the hide lasted so long it
      was used for tow different purposes.&nbsp; Upper parts were made&nbsp;
      rain&nbsp; proof by the grease and smoke of many cooking fires.&nbsp;
      Indian women would stitch it for the wet seasons.&nbsp; Both the men and
      the women butchered the buffalos.&nbsp; The Blackfoot considered the
      butchering for the men, other people recognized the chore as a men and
      women chore.&nbsp;</font></p>

      that you think it would be.&nbsp; The call they used was a ritual.&nbsp;
      They used buffalo hair, and the Blackfoot used stones that looked like
      buffalo for the calling.&nbsp; These stones were called &quot;buffalo
      stones&quot;.&nbsp; Each tribe had some kind id special song that they
      sang.&nbsp; When they sang their songs they believed it would make the
      buffalo approach their camp site.&nbsp; Comanche hunters would find a
      horned toad and they would ask it where the buffalo were.&nbsp; Of course
      the toad wouldn't tell them where the buffalo were, but wherever the toad
      scrambled off than that was where the buffalo were.&nbsp; Some tribes had
      a hoop game which &quot;called&quot; the buffalo to them. Blood was drank
      just to quench their thirst.&nbsp; Often the chase of a herd lasted for
      hours.&nbsp; They usually made their kill far away from any water so they
      drank the blood as water.&nbsp; When tribes went in large groups to kill
      they would get loads of meat.&nbsp; They had parties when they killed so
      many.&nbsp; Several pounds of meat was eaten by each of the men.&nbsp;</font></td>

      <p align="left"><font face="Elephant">&quot;Kill off the buffalo and you kill off the
      Indians.&quot; said Sherdian.&nbsp; If the buffalo were to disappear, the Indians
      would starve and their tribes would then be forced off to reservations the
      whites chose to put them on.&nbsp; In 1800 there were about 60 million
      buffalo on the Plains.&nbsp; 70 years later the numbers dropped down to
      about 1,000.&nbsp; The slaughter began in the early 1860's with the
      building of the railroad.&nbsp; Rather than pay for meat the railroad
      workers would pay hunters to come and kill the buffalo for food.&nbsp;
      When this started buffalo hunting became a great source of entertainment
      for sports men who went out West in railroad cars.&nbsp; With the slow
      moving cars they shot the buffalo while sitting in the cars. &quot;A
      uniquely American Scene.&quot; reported one British traveler.&nbsp; The
      people skinned the buffalo and sold the hides as leather.&nbsp; They then
      would sell it for $3.00.&nbsp; The hunters would kill about 50 buffalo a
      day.&nbsp; Some people said they would kill 1,500 in a single week.&nbsp;
      &quot;When you killed off the buffalo you also killed off the &quot;Wild
      Indians&quot;.&quot; Lame Deer said.&nbsp; He also said the white men said
      that the buffalo were stupid because they were to easy to shoot, they
      weren't afraid of the gun.&nbsp; Without the buffalos all the Indians
      could not have survived, at least not on the Great Plains.</font></td>
