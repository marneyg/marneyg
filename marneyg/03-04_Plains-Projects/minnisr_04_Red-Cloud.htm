      Red Cloud's tribe, they became infuriated and decided to begin a war
      against Red Cloud and his tribe.&nbsp; Red Cloud knew the government would
      soon attack, so he must prepare.&nbsp; The single most memorable thing
      that Red Cloud ever did was winning the Fatal Fetterman Fight.&nbsp; The
      troops that were led by Fetterman reached the Peno Valley, an enormous
      force of Indians rose from the high grass.&nbsp; Arrows along with some
      bullets flew as the ambushers unleashed their mighty and unstoppable

      formed a defensive circle farther up the slope.&nbsp; That means there was
      only three very small groups of soldiers trying to fend off a very vast
      army of Indians that was superior in every way.&nbsp; On an estimation the
      Indian group shot off about forty thousand arrows during the fight.&nbsp;
      Wheatly and Fisher both had sixteen-shot Henry repeating rifles and thus
      were better armed than the soldiers.&nbsp; The cavalrymen had seven-shot
      Spencer repeating carbines, but the foot soldiers had to make their last
      stand with cruddy obsolete Springfield muzzleloaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>
