      The Comanche tribes'
      nickname from many&nbsp; people was &quot; Lords of the
      Plains&quot;.&nbsp; They were once said to be the most important tribe in
      the plains states.&nbsp; Most of this had to do with having the largest
      and best herd of horses of any Indian tribe, and being a very feared
      warrior.&nbsp; It was also once said that on a horse, a Comanche had no

      Comanche, you think of horse.&nbsp; They are believed to be the first
      Native Americans to use and breed the horse so well.&nbsp; Comanches even
      supplied Americans with their horses during gold rushes.&nbsp; For this
      reason the Comanche were probably the most important tribe of the Great
      Plains.&nbsp; Their name is somewhat similar to the picture image of a
      &quot;wild indian&quot; which, some say, is deserved having remembered
      that they robbed almost every horse and mule in new Mexico and Northern
      Mexico.&nbsp; The Comanche also put a good dent in the available stock in
      Texas.&nbsp; Plains horse culture grew and when George Catlin was a guest
      of the Comanche he stated: &quot;I am ready without hesitation, to
      pronounce the Comanches the most extraordinary horsemen that I have seen
      yet in all my travels, and I doubt very much whether any people in the
      world can surpass them.&quot; He also stated this very detailed description
      of a Comanche warrior...&quot;he is able to drop his body upon the side of
      his horse at the instant he is passing, effectually&nbsp; screened from
      his enemies' weapons as he lies in a horizontal position behind the body
      of his horse, with his heel hanging over the horse's back; by which he has
      the power of throwing himself up again, and changing to the other side of
      the horse if necessary.&nbsp; In this wonderful condition he will hang
      whilst his horse is at fullest speed carrying with him his bow and his
      shield, and also his long lance of fourteen feet in length all or either
      of which he will use upon his enemy as he passes; raising and throwing his
      arrows over the horse's back or with equal ease and equal success under
      the horse's neck.&quot; They were able to do this because they would drop
      their weight into a short hair-braid under the horse's neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      horses other tribes could only dream about.&nbsp; Because the Comanches
      stole so many horses, in 1775 the Spanish Governor of New Mexico was
      complaining that the Comanche raiders had stolen so many herds of horses
      in New Mexico, he did not have enough to re-supply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

        women's corsets, and so on making them look like a circus.&nbsp; People would have
      found this funny if they weren't so dangerous.&nbsp; They would usually
      kill men prisoners at the scene, but women and children were brought back
      to their village.&nbsp; The women were usually raped, enslaved, and kept
      for the sale of slaves or ransom.&nbsp; Children were either sold as
