      Chief Joseph was born in the Wallowa Valley what is today Oregon in the year of 1840.&nbsp; Joseph was given the name Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekt, or
      Thunder Rolling Down the Mountain.&nbsp; He was mostly known as Joseph ,
      or Joseph the Younger named after his father.&nbsp; The Nez Perce tribe
      was to big to be under one chief.&nbsp; Josephs people lived in the Imaha
      or Grande Ronde Valley in Oregon.&nbsp; Josephs tribe had 60 men and 130
      women and children.&nbsp; Joseph and
      his men crossed over the Salmon River, hoping they would be
      followed.&nbsp; Joseph and Josephs people got between Howard and his
      supplies and they cut Howard off for three days.&nbsp; Joseph attempted to
      get back with his wife and children, but one of General Miles soldiers had
      cut the Indian camp inn two.&nbsp; Almost seventy men, Joseph among them,
      were cut off.&nbsp;</font></td>

      first white men to enter the Indians country.&nbsp; They were liked by all
      the Indians.&nbsp; The Nez Perce let them pass through their
      country.&nbsp; They also promised not to ever make war on the white men. The
      Indians
      liked the white people at first because they taught them new ways and
      traded with the Indian.&nbsp; The white men were Frenchmen and they called
      the Indians &quot;Nez Perce,&quot; because the Indians wore rings in
      their noses for ornaments. But then white people started moving into the Indians country and lived
      there.&nbsp; Quickly the Indians found out that the whites were becoming
      very wealthy.&nbsp; Joseph the Elder was the first Indian to see bad things
      were to come and he warned all his people.&nbsp; He also told them not to
      get ripped off when they trade.&nbsp; While the white people were living
      in the Mountains around the land of the Winding Water they stole many
      important things from the Indians.&nbsp; At first the Indians didn't want
      to invade the Indians too much then they later started to take land away
      from the Indians.</font></td>

      When gold and silver were found in Nevada it became bad for the
      Indians.&nbsp; Whites were storming in to take the Indians land and also
      take away anything the Indians had that was worth anything.
      In 1855, Joseph the Elder helped Washington's territorial governor set up
      a reservation called the Nez Perce.&nbsp; This reservation went from
      Oregon into Idaho.&nbsp; This took away a lot of land from the Indians
      just so the white people could be happy.
      Even though the Indians moved out of the land they had surrendered.&nbsp;
      They had nothing to do but go look for someplace they could live.&nbsp;
      Finally land was set aside for the Indians.&nbsp; The land the Indians got
      was the land that no body wanted.&nbsp; It was no good for nothing they couldn't
      really grow crops on it because it had terrible soil.</font></td>

      He wanted the Indians and his people separated.&nbsp; They wanted the
      Indians to live on a piece of land and stay on it.&nbsp; Joseph the Elder

      you are not a child, I am no child either; I can think for myself.&nbsp;
      No man can think for me.&nbsp; I have no other home than this .&nbsp; I

      put up poles around the boundaries and said:&nbsp; &quot;Inside is the

      Inside this boundary all our people were born.&nbsp; It circles around the
      graves of our fathers, and we will never give it up the graves to any

      Lawyer a Chief, was named this because he was a great talker.&nbsp; He
      took over the council, and sold almost all the Nez Perce Country.&nbsp;
      The United States said
      they bought all the Nez Perce country outside of Lapwai Reservation, but
      the Indians continued to live on the land in peace until a few years
      later.&nbsp; The whites began to go inside the boundaries.&nbsp; This made

      In 1877, General Oliver Otis Howard attacked Joseph and his people with
      his cavalry.&nbsp; Joseph ended up having to head his band toward
      Idaho.&nbsp; But they never made it there Josephs men attacked some white
      settlers and this brought the army out to pursue Josephs people.&nbsp;
      General William Tecumseh Sherman was impressed by the Indians march and
      said,&quot; the Indians throughout displayed a courage and skill that elected
      universal praise.&nbsp; (They) fought with almost scientific skill, using
      advance and rear guards, skirmish lines, and field fortifications." In
      October 5, 1877, Joseph and his men surrendered.&nbsp; To the American
      Press he was known as &quot;The Napoleon.&quot;&nbsp; Even though he
      surrendered knowing that he would be allowed to go back home, his people
      and him were taken to&nbsp; Eastern Kansas and then they were taken to a
      place called Indian Territory (Oklahoma).&nbsp; Many of his people died
      due to epidemic diseases.</font>&nbsp; In 1885 Joseph and his band were
      brought back to the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp; Then half of them were taken
      to a Non-Nez Perce reservation in Northern Washington, away from the rest
      of their people.&nbsp; Joseph the Younger died in 1904, his doctor said
      this occurred from &quot;a broken heart.&quot;</td>
