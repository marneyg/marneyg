      Indian.&nbsp; He was exceptionally honored as a warrior, fighter, son,
      leader, and chief.&nbsp; It is somewhat surprising that there is so much
      information to be found about this very shy man, because he kept to
      himself and he was only popular the last years of his short life. He dose
      not have mounds of quotes because he didn't come&nbsp; out and speak his
      mind all the time like other great chiefs. Crazy Horse was a man that kept
      his feelings and emotions to himself. Crazy Horse was born on the
      Republican River in 1842. He lived through a wonderfully strong and adventurous
      life time, for a short thirty-five years until his tragic death at Fort
      Robinson Nebraska, in 1877.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      <a href="archer_04_sittingbull.htm"> Sitting
      Bulls</a> mind about&nbsp; who would help him most in fighting the whites. He
      chose Crazy Horse, leader of the Oglala Sioux.&nbsp; They were very
      different men, Sitting Bull was laughing constantly, cracking jokes and
      singing songs he would make up on his own. Crazy Horse on the other hand
      was quite different, he hardly ever talked, &quot;Our Strange Man&quot;,
      the Oglala called him. He irregularly smiled. He was a man filled with
      bitterness. When Sitting Bull in was forty-five years old and was stocky
      with broad-shoulders.&nbsp; While Crazy Horse was 26 at the time and was
      as slim as a boy. His skin and his hair were very light colored.&nbsp;
      When he was young he was called &quot;Light-Haired Boy&quot; or
      &quot;Curly&quot; because of the wavy hair of his. But don't think that
      young Curly was born so cold hearted there are reasons for his
      harshness.&nbsp; For instance, he had seen way too much violence at too
      young of an age. Curly had come upon the Brule' village, of his mothers
      people, when General Harney and his soldiers had killed 86 Indians.&nbsp;
      The sight of the dead filled young Crazy Horse with a bitterness that
      lasted all of his life.&nbsp; He also knew that general Harney had sent
      his uncle, Spotted Tail, away to the white man's country with chains on is
      hand and an iron ball on his feet.&nbsp;</font></td>

      Sitting Bull towards Crazy Horse was religion. As a boy Crazy Horse had a
      strong vision.&nbsp; Which was something that Sitting Bull strongly
      desired himself.&nbsp; The vision would tell them about their future. a
      boy would learn which girls he would marry (Sioux men were allowed more
      than one), and the enemies he would kill. He would find out what feathers
      to wear in his hair, what paint to out on his face, and what design to put
      on his shield.&nbsp; He may even learn how he would die.&nbsp; Once Curly
      slipped away from camp and after days of lonely hunger and thirst he had a
      dream. He dreamt that his horse was coming towards him with a rider on its
      back. There was no paint on his face, but behind his ear was a small
      smooth stone.&nbsp; Arrows and bullets flew around him but they didn't touch
      him.&nbsp; People-it seemed to him his own people-came around the rider
      and clutched at him and tried to hold him back. He shook them off. Now
      Curly could see a zigzag lightning streak on the riders cheek and white
      hail stones spotted on his body.&nbsp; The people still garbed at him, trying
      to hold him back, but they didn't succeed. Then a little red-backed hawk
      flew over the riders head.&nbsp; He was the rider.</font></td>

      ordered the Lokota Chiefs to report to their&nbsp; reservations by January

      refused.&nbsp; On May 6, 1877,&nbsp; Crazy Horse and 889 other Oglala
      Indians appeared outside of Camp Robinson close to the Red Cloud
      Agency.&nbsp; It was a huge deal because they were the last major group
      of&nbsp; Lakota holdouts on American soil to surrender.&nbsp; Crazy Horse
      was quoted saying that he had given all he had to Red Cloud that
      day.&nbsp; There, Crazy Horse's loyal followers and friends and the agency
      Indians began cheering and singing for him.&nbsp; &quot;By God,&quot; said
      a&nbsp; Army Officer who witnessed the event, &quot;this is a triumphal

      Once late summer had arrived,
      rumors were going around saying that Crazy Horse was planning to return to
      battle.&nbsp; On September 4, 1877, the chiefs including Red Cloud,
      Spotted Tail, No Water, and of course Crazy Horse rode out of camp
      Robinson with four hundred agency warriors.&nbsp; Eight companies of the
      Third Calvary went to Camp&nbsp; Robinson to arrest Crazy Horse, about six
      miles away, they found he had fled, along with his wife Black Shawl, who
      was suffering from tuberculosis. They where headed to the Spotted Tail
      Agency in hopes of finding a more peaceful existence.&nbsp; At the Spotted
      Tail Agency he was greeted by Touch the Clouds and other friendly
      warriors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      Captain Daniel Bruke and
      Lieutenant&nbsp; Jesse M. Lee promised him that the Army did not wish to
      harm him and would listen to his side of the story.&nbsp; On September 5,
      Crazy Horse took the trail toward Camp Robinson, along with Lee, Bordeaux,
      Touch the Clouds and others. Lee immediately went to the office of Colonel
      Bradely but had little luck smoothing things over.&nbsp; Bradely
      hesitated, but replied, &quot;Tell him to go with the officer of the day
      and not a hair on his head should be harmed.&quot;&nbsp; Now Crazy Horse
      apparently believed that he was going to meet with the commander in the
      morning.&nbsp; Captain James Kennington, two soldiers and Little Big Man,
      then took Crazy Horse to the nearby guard house. He suddenly realized what
      was going on and that he was going to be locked up. Pulling out a knife
      that he managed to hide under his blanket and spring for the door Crazy
      Horse wrenched his arm free.&nbsp; Little Big Man grabbed Crazy Horse's
      arm, &quot;Let me go, let me go; you wont allow me to hurt anyone,&quot;
      Crazy Horse said as he slashed Little Big Mans wrist.&nbsp; At that point
      Kennington ordered guardhouse security William Gentles to &quot;Stab the
      son of a bitch&quot;. Doing what he was told Gentles lunged his bayonet
      into Crazy Horses left kidney.&nbsp; &quot;He has killed me now,&quot;
      Crazy Horse declared as he fell. &quot;Let me go my friends. You have got
      me hurt enough.&quot; Touch the Clouds then said, &quot;He was a great
      chief and cannot be put in a prison.&quot;&nbsp; Colonel Bradley was then
      convinced that there would be more killings if Crazy Horse was put into a
      cell. Touch the Clouds then brought V into a office where he wanted to be
      on the flour, closer to the earth.&nbsp; Touch the Clouds&nbsp; stayed
      until just before midnight when Crazy Horse died. The others with him were
      his farther, Worm, Captain Kennington, Lieutenant Henry R Lemley,
      interpreter John Provos and Mr. McGillyCuddy. Crazy Horses last words
      aren't known but he did reportedly tell Worm: &quot;ah, my farther, I am
      hurt bad.&nbsp; Tell the people it is no use to depend on me any
      more.&quot;&nbsp;</font></td>
