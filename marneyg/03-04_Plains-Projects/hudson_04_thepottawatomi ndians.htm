      was believed to come to North America between 1765 and 1795.&nbsp; The
      Pottawatomi mainly lived around the Great Lakes or around Michigan, where
      they first moved onto land to live on.&nbsp; It is believed that the
      Pottawatomi moved around alot, but mainly around the Great Lakes or around
      Michigan lands.&nbsp; The Pottawatomi were Algunquain-speaking people who
      lived by the Great Lakes.&nbsp; The Pottawatomi were believed to travel

      the Neshnabek before they were called the Pottawatomi.&nbsp; Neshnabek
      means &quot;The People&quot; and Pottawatomi meaning &quot;The People of
      the Place of the Fire&quot;, which is written on the Citizen Pottawatomi
      Nation's symbol, along with other Pottawatomi things.&nbsp; Pottawatomi is
      spelled many different ways, Pottawatomi can be spelled Pottawatomi or
      Potawatomi, and the are probably other spellings too.&nbsp; Pottawatomi
      got there name from the Ojibwe, when they were a tribe of the Algonguin
      race.&nbsp; The Odawas were also included in the tribe with the
      Pottawatomi. As the Pottawatomi learned many things as they moved from
      place to place.&nbsp; They learned suck things as how to use snowshoes,
      tabaggons, and canoes.&nbsp; Other Indian tribes didn't know how to use
      these things, so the Pottawatomi had a advantage over them.&nbsp; The
      Pottawatomi also learned a clan system and followed it.&nbsp; They
      couldn't marry inside of a clan by following the system.&nbsp; The
      Pottawatomi had a leader inside each clan, instead of having one main
      tribal chief. They learned how to farm from the Sauk, Fox, Kickapoo, and
      Winnebago between 1630-1700.&nbsp; In 1600 when the Pottawatomi was
      threatened by the Ontario they moved from lower Michigan to the Westside
      of Lake Michigan in northern Wisconsin in 1641.&nbsp; All or most all
      Pottawatomi were living in Wisconsin's Door Peninsula in 1665.&nbsp;
      Around 1760 the Pottawatomi expanded themselves into central Illinois and northern
      Indiana.&nbsp; Around the 1830's when removal to Kansas and Iowa was
      happening some of the Pottawatomi Indians escaped to Canada</font></b></td>

      him Master of All Life, met the Neshnabek he taught the Neshanbek how to
      make and use bark canoes, pottery, bows and arrows, bark and rushing mat
      covered wigwams.&nbsp; Wiske also taught the Pottawatomi how to use
      animals and plants.&nbsp; The Neshnabek also learned how to divie into
      families, clans, and villages, each of the families, clans, or villages
      had a wkama or chief.&nbsp; From Wiske the Pottawatomi learned how to
      protect themselves by rituals, and also learned the importance of their
      dreams and visions.&nbsp; All that said about Wiske and the Pottawatomi
      all came from a Pottawtomi Genesis.&nbsp; The Pottawatomi had many origin
      myths, infact each caln had it's own myth of how a founder got their
      special power to create a new clan it is said that they got their special
      power from their visions.&nbsp; The Neshnabek even had myths of how people
      got their horses and why women shouldn't be chiefs.&nbsp; Wiske was just

      Lake Michigan.&nbsp; When the Pottawatomi did flee it made a panic for the
      horticultural tribes of Michigan. Armies came from the East for what
      Jesuits called &quot;wars of extermination&quot;.&nbsp; This army was from
      the Ontario Peninsula and were called the Neutrals by the French, because
      their territory was between warring tribes.&nbsp; In later years, when the
      Neutrals of French had attacks on them, it destroyed the Neutrals of
      French and related tribes in Ontario.&nbsp; After 1680, when the Iroquois
      were assaulting tribes south of the Great Lakes, the Pottawatomi were
      taken captive.&nbsp; The Pottawatomi escaped to avoid invaders, and
      escaped to the shores of Green Bay.&nbsp; When they escaped to the shores
      of Green Bay the were joined by the Sauk, Fox, Kickapoo, Miami, and other tribes
      trying to avoid invaders.&nbsp; In 1653 New York Iroquois sent a army to destroy

      Pottawatomi made a fortified village called Mitchigam meaning &quot;Great

      New York Iroquois tried to destroy&nbsp; the tribes, they couldn't win so
      they stoped trying to defeat the tribes.&nbsp; The Pottawatomi offered a
      feast to the New York Iroquois, but when they had the feast the
      Pottawatomi feed the New York Iroquois Poisoned corn.&nbsp; After words
      the Iroquois fled and were almost destroyed by the tribes. The Iroquois
      even tried two more times to destroy the tribes, but the Iroquois just
      couldn't destroy the tribes.&nbsp; In the end the Pottawatomi ended up destroying

      The Pottawatomi sold there land to purchase Indian&nbsp; Territory in
