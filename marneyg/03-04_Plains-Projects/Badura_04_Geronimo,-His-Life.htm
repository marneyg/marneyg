      families of the warriors were hidden in a camp in the mountains.&nbsp; The
      tribes marched in three different divisions.&nbsp; Each tribe was a
      different division.&nbsp; They marched about fourteen hours a day, making
      three meal-stops.&nbsp; They traveled an average of forty miles a
      day.&nbsp; When they were outside of Arispe, a Mexican town, they
      camped.&nbsp; Eight men came from the city to parley.&nbsp; The Apache

      Mexican force attacked.&nbsp; There were two regiments of cavalry and two
      of infantry.&nbsp; The Apaches were again victorious.&nbsp; Geronimo was
