      warriors.&nbsp; The warriors are from Chief&nbsp; Black Kettle's village
      which is called the Sand Creek Massacre.&nbsp; This happened on November
      29, 1864, with Colonel John Chivington as the primary villain.&nbsp; Soon
      a private letter was written by Lt. Col. Sam F. Tappen wrote it to his
      brother Lew.&nbsp; Tappen told his brother stuff about &quot;Ned&quot;
      Wynkoop.&nbsp; Tappen told his brother to keep the information under his
      hat. Tappen wrote his letter on May 15,1862.&nbsp; The Tappen brother's
      were accused by Michno for being co-conspirators.&nbsp; They were the best
      of friends.&nbsp; Soon Ned wrote a formal letter to Tappen on January 2,
      1869,a little bit after the battle of Washita.&nbsp; Tappen got&nbsp;
      things figured out with Col. Chivington back on January 23, 1873, he wrote
      from camp Weld, &quot;From the earliest organization of out regiment you
      have done your utmost by out spoken remarks and secret intimations to
      destroy my influence as an officer in the regiment.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I
      appeal to you in the behalf of cause in which we are both
      engaged....&quot;&nbsp; Michno said, &quot;On September 1864. Some Indians
      brought in a note from hostile tribes that indicated their desire for
      peace talks, and Wynkoop was determined to pay them a visit.&quot;&nbsp;
      On June 27, 1864, John Evans issued "Friendly Indians of the plains,
      &quot; he said,' direct that all friendly Indians keep away from those who
      are at war, and go to places of safety...&nbsp; Friendly Arapahos and Cheyenne's...
      will go to Major Colley, U.S. Indians agent at Fort Lyon, who will... show
      them a place of safety...&quot; Evans sad again, &quot;so far as making a
      treaty now is concerned, we are in no condition to do it.&quot;&nbsp;
      Chivington told the Indians, &quot;They are nearer to Major Wynkoop than
      any one else, and they can go to him when they get ready to do
      that.&quot;&nbsp; Michno calls Silas &quot;a poetry-quoting friend of Walt
      Whitman's,&quot; which is right , I was thinking if in 1864 that men sing
      in the shower.&nbsp; But 1864 was a long summer for Silas.&nbsp; He wrote
      a letter to his mother on July 29, 1864, saying, &quot;all I care for is
      to have part of the farm in Kansas to live on when I get out of the
      service.&nbsp; &quot; Silas wrote to Chivington on October 11th of
      1864saying, &quot;I am anxious to hear from Denver hoping to receive
      orders to return: My company should be mustered out this month but the
      Major, (Wynkoop), says he cannot spare us the past....&quot;&nbsp; Then he
      said, &quot;I wish to make application about next February for a furlough to
      go Kans to see my mother and sister.&nbsp; I have not been across the Mo.
      River but once in ten years and have officially or unofficially I shall
      always be pleased to do.&nbsp; Yours Respectfully Silas S. Soule.&nbsp;
      &quot; On October 17, he wrote back to Chivington saying, &quot;I have
      made application to Major Wynkoop to order me to Denver to have my company
      mustered out.... &quot; Then he said, &quot;The Major refuses to
      let me go....&quot;&nbsp;</b></font>

      Evans Portrayed men that made the massacre of 1864 happen, Edward Wynkoop
      was in the scoundrels affair he was at the top of the list.&nbsp; In 1864
      of November, 700 soldiers went after Black Kettle's village of 500 Cheyenne's
      and Arapahos from Sand Creek, were 35 miles northeast of the fort.&nbsp;
      Colonel Chivington got to Fort Lyon- Colorado Territory with 3rd cavalry.&nbsp;
      Major Anthony who joined the six companies the 1st Colorado Cavalry on
      29th of 1864.&nbsp; They killed 120 Indians and captured 70 others.&nbsp;
      But the fight is called the Sand Creek Massacre.&nbsp; It is a struggle of
      good and evil.&nbsp; Every event would change within time.&nbsp; It was
      bad from the beginning.&nbsp; Evans and Chivington plus the 3rd Colorado
      Volunteers.&nbsp; Some White hats and black hats were found to be
      gray.&nbsp; The hat colors should be changed.&nbsp; But the Sand Creek
      Massacre from machinations a half-dozen people.&nbsp; Major Edward W.
      Wynkoop joined the Colorado Volunteers after traveling a long road.&nbsp;
      His nick name was &quot;Ned&quot;.&nbsp; He was&nbsp; born in Philadelphia
      in 1836.&nbsp; He went to Leavenworth, Kansas by 1858.&nbsp; He got
      to&nbsp; be Arapahoe sheriff.&nbsp; He became a Saloon/brothel in 1869 at
      Denver when he'd first arrived,&nbsp; Denver Inter-Ocean would say,
      &quot;a bad man from Kansas, who wore buckskin breeches and carried a brownie-Knife
      and revolver in his belt.&quot; Then a little bit later he was elected
      Marshal on April&nbsp; of 1861.&nbsp; On march of 1862 he rode in to the battle
      of Apache Canyon, it was going to be a three-day battle. It was called
      Glorieta Pass - New Mexico Territory he won a promotion of a Major.&nbsp;
      Then he spent the rest of the year in Denver at a camp.&nbsp; By 1864,
      Wynkoop took command at Fort Lyon.&nbsp; Boredom made men and officers go
      to Denver for Chivington. A colonel conduct Wynkoop.&nbsp; Major Curtis,
      wrote Chivington a letter saying Wynkoop's fault for sending parties from
      the district.&nbsp; Chivington tried to help Wynkoop but a major drew
      attention to him and his colonel.&nbsp; Chivington made a place under Mag.
      Gen James G. Blunt.&nbsp; This is what made Wynkoop future trouble
      change.&nbsp; Soon John S.Smith and Samuel G. Colley were acquainted with
      Wynkoop.&nbsp; Smith was called &quot;Lying John.&quot;&nbsp; Bent said
      the Colley made $30.000 with in three years.&nbsp; Sam Colley would paint pessimistic
      pictures in letters to Evans.&nbsp; &quot;The Indians are very
      troublesome,&quot; he would say. &quot;I have made application to Major
      Wynkoop for troops....&nbsp; It looks at present as though we shall have
      to fight them all.&quot;&nbsp; But in early of September of 1864, Indians
      brought a note about peace talks.&nbsp; Wynkoop is going to visit
      them.&nbsp; He knew he was under the command of Gen. Blunt.&nbsp; Blunt
      order Wynkoop on August of 1864 to &quot;confine your operations to the defense
      of your post and give such protection to the road and mail coaches
      as you can afford.&quot;&nbsp; Blunt and Curtis agreed that the Indians
      should be hurt.&nbsp; Wynkoop knew they were getting ready to fight.&nbsp;
      He's been out of the district lines before.&nbsp; He didn't ask for
      permission for what he did.&nbsp; Soon 125 men of the 1st Colorado went to
      the Smoky Hill River with no orders from Blunt or Curtis.&nbsp; John Smith
      was with them.&nbsp; Sam Colley Stayed Back to tell the others.&nbsp; Some
      men told Wynkoop to back to the fort.&nbsp; But they returned with four of
      the seven captives.&nbsp; Plus Chiefs such as Black Kettle for a
      meeting.&nbsp; But Evans nor Chivington wanted peace conference during a
      war.&nbsp; After a while Evans wrote a letter to Colley.&nbsp; He told
      him.&nbsp; &quot;You will be particular to impress upon these chiefs,&nbsp;the
      fact that my talk with them was for the purpose of ascertaining their
      views, and not to offer them anything whatever.&quot;&nbsp; He didn't want
      the Indians think that we were going to continue war.&nbsp; But it didn't
      think Colley would listen to him.&nbsp; The Indians didn't make any peace
      treaty as they were going back to Denver.&nbsp; Wynkoop said, the Indians
      should move close to their fort.&nbsp; But Fort Lyon was another Sand
      Creek villain.&nbsp; Where Silas S.Soule stayed.&nbsp; He had an up right
      thing going on more than Wynkoop but he was in the hole.&nbsp; A friend of
      Soule named Walt Whitmas lived by his favorite phrase.&nbsp; &quot;You may
      have the argument, but by God, I know I'm right!&quot;&nbsp; He became a
      Jayhawker in his teens.&nbsp; Then in 1859 Silas Soule was not liked by
      Indians.&nbsp; He wrote a letter to his sister.&nbsp; He told her .&nbsp;
      &quot;The Cheyenne's also know a trick or two.&nbsp; Some of them steal a
      girl....&nbsp; Out of Kansas, trade her from lodge to lodge, then come up
      with her at our parley on the Smoky Hill last month.&nbsp; A gift
      say.&nbsp; They want to steal a peace 'forever'.&nbsp; Of course they'd
      killed the father, (and) the mother hanged herself.&quot;&nbsp; Colley was
      after him.&nbsp; Mrs. Colley who was selling the
      Indians annuities.&nbsp; Soule said.&nbsp; &quot;The Indians agent's wife
      sells pies she makes with Cheyenne flour allowance.&nbsp; Mrs.Colley [sic]
      got more rations on her hands than the U.S. Cavalry and Northern tribes
      combined.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></td>

      <p align="left"><font face="Eras Medium ITC" color="#FF0000"><b>Later on November 29,1864, Colonel John M. Chivington went
      up on the ridge sometime around dawn.&nbsp; He sent out 750 Colorado
      Volunteers and four 1216 howitzers.&nbsp; He saw 100 tepees of Cheyenne's
      and 30 tepees of Arapaho allies going for a mile across the Big Sandy
      Creek in Colorado.&nbsp; Black Kettle was the leader of the village.&nbsp;
      Soon Colonel Chivington thought he would become a hero, only
      slightly.&nbsp; His mantle was swept away and placed with devil
      horns.&nbsp; Because of his actions and testimony he gave before a Senate
      Committee in March 1865, Chivington was seen as a villain.&nbsp; People
      saw what happened that day.&nbsp; So sand Creek war attacked by Chivington.&nbsp;
      They attacked Black Kettle's, Cheyenne's and Arapaho friends.&nbsp; They
      did not tell them anything about it.&nbsp; The battles we usely read is
      how the kick butt and whipping out the village but not this one.&nbsp;
      There was torture, scalp and mutilated bodies.&nbsp; About 2/3 women and
      children were killed from Black Kettle's village.&nbsp; But maybe Sand
      Creek was a thing that the white men were waiting to happen.&nbsp; Senate
      Committee questioned the Hearings.&nbsp; Every reference tells the same
      thing.&nbsp; Colorado excepted Chivington and they went crazy over him,
      they named him after the town, because he was a Civil War hero.&nbsp;
      After all this had happened on April 1861, William Gilpin offered to him
      Chaplain.&nbsp; Chivington was to say.&nbsp; &quot;I feel compelled to
      strike a bow in person for the destruction of&nbsp; human
      slavery....&quot;&nbsp; He was appointed to be a Volunteer Regiment.&nbsp;
      Some months later, &quot;Fighting Parson&quot; got the job as a Military
      District of Colorado.&nbsp; He was everything with the White and
      Indians.&nbsp; The Indians found out that the white men weren't just
      passing though.&nbsp; The men were farmers and raised cattle.&nbsp; They
      put the cattle on the buffalo lands and tore up the lands with
      plows.&nbsp; The Cheyenne's and Arapaho's thought that the white men would leave. Black Kettle went to Denver. He believe that the whites would
      move west.&nbsp; Black Kettle hopes they don't say any to make his people
      angry and he hoped that the white men would leave and get off the
      Indians lands. But the whites did not leave and it made the Cheyenne's
      even made mad.&nbsp; They respected avocation of the war with the Ute's
      and Pawnee's.&nbsp; They scared the whites going to war.&nbsp; But on the
      whites back it was worst they had scalps of Ute's with them.&nbsp; Cheyenne's
      and Arapaho's stole cattle, provision the horses from the whites.
      The Cheyenne's and Arapaho's war ponies were close to dying.&nbsp; It wasn't
      fun playing war games in the winter.&nbsp; They were told peace in the
      winter was normal.&nbsp; They did it so they could get food and clothes
      for warmth.&nbsp; But Cheyenne's were starving so they took the cattle
      from the white men.&nbsp; They attack on people traving through increased
      in 1863.&nbsp; But it still continued in eastern Colorado during the
      spring of 1864.&nbsp; Though Chivington was under the order to Maj. Gen.
      Samuel Ryan Curtis, who thought the Indians &quot;babied&quot; it was hard
      for the Indians on a &quot;realistic&quot; basis.&nbsp; On June 11, 1864,
      toured bodies of Nathan Hungate and his family was brought to town and let
      everyone see them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone was scared after that.&nbsp; Every
      trail from now on had raids of men.&nbsp; Mining towns were running short
      on supplies.&nbsp; There were more stories on their way.&nbsp; After that
      Evans and some people thought&nbsp; there was a Indian uprising.&nbsp;
      Governor wrote messages to tribes saying some forts will get some supplies
      and keep safe from dangerous Indians.&nbsp; By July, Kiowa Chief Satonta
      was degusted when he had to go see Fort Larned in Kansas.&nbsp; He put an
      arrow in the arm of a sentry.&nbsp; They ran off horses of the
      forts.&nbsp; Cheyenne and Arapaho chiefs with a white flag entered Fort
      Learned to discussed the problem, the solders fired cannon at them.&nbsp;
      They the Indians looked the Indians looked the same to them. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
