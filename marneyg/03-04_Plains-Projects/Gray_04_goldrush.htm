      Indians were conquered, and died, in innumerable little episodes of cruel
      leaders or a few squads of rough soldiers, but in effect, an entire
      people; for the conquest of the Native Californian was above all else a
      popular, mass enterprise.'-Jack Forbes, contemporary Native Historian. ' Gold's
      a devilish sort of thing. You lose your sense of values and character
      changes entirely. Your soul stops being the same as it was before.'-The
      Treasure of Sierra Madre. 'The attacking party rushed upon them, blowing
      out their brains and splitting their heads with tomahawks. Little children
      in baskets, even babies had their heads smashed to pieces or cut open.
      Mothers and infants shared the same phenomenon...many of the fugitives
      were chased and shot as they ran...The children, scarcely able to run,
      toddled towards the squaw for protection, crying with fright, but were
      overtaken, slaughtered like wild animals, and thrown into piles... One
      woman got into a pond hole ,where she hid herself under the grass, and
      concealed her papoose on the bank in a basket, she was discovered and her
      head blown to pieces, the muzzle of the gun being placed against her skull
      and the child was drowned in the pond.'-Captain Jarboe among the Achomawi
      people of the North-east. The Indians were probably the happiest and most
      peaceful race on the continent until they were forced and twisted into
      depressed and desperate people with their lands stolen.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Agency FB" color="#000000" size="4">Some Indians, in fact, surprisingly almost half the miners were Indians,
      they were called &quot;diggers&quot;, because of this they created
      complications as it brought some against their own people and they chose
      to believe that the savage white men were their friends who saw that they
      could use them to get more gold. When taken advantage of and it was
      obvious to the Indians, brought even more complications as this left many
      of the Indians in situations where they didn't know where to turn, having
      left their people and being turned down by the settlers who cared nothing
      of them and killed them afterwards. Consequently, some of these Indians
      struck gold, sending white settlers in and taking the the gold and the
      area away from them and killing anyone who protested against them. The
      settlers believed this not to be wrong and it wasn't considered a crime
      for stealing their claim. What fueled the settlers to do their crimes was that
      in a nine year period(1848-1852) an estimated 24.3 million ounces of gold
      was prospected during the California Gold Rush; the value of the is around
      $6.9 billion worth of the precious metal. ($285 an ounce) The Indians were
      taken advantage of by the settlers, the settlers saw that Indians saw
      little value in gold and much more interest in things the settlers could
      get easily, so the Indians were cheated out in unfair trades for things
      like glass beads. Some Indians though discovered how much gold was valued
      to the prospectors and started to demand for more valuable things. Some
      earlier conflicts between the Indians and the whites made later settlers
      believe they cold take over the Native Americans too. One example of one
      of these earlier conflicts was when the first arrival of Europeans forced
      over sixteen-thousand Natives&nbsp;&nbsp;to be baptized, over nine
      thousand of them died. A problem that seemed to make it's way through
      history was that the Indians took so long to become immune to the whites
      lies and their tendency to break their promise or treaty. There was a
      total of thirteen peace treaties, all which failed to yield to the Indians
      rights and the numerous times when a settler would trade unfairly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

    <font face="Agency FB">3. Massacres and Genocide- </font></font>
      <p><font face="Agency FB" color="#000000" size="4">Many miners and ranchers came together for the cause
      and purpose of killing off the Indians. The men who were involved in such
      acts hit especially hard on the Native Americans living in or near the
      heart of the Mother Lode, mostly these people were from the Nisenan Maidu
      and Miwok tribes. The following are some examples of this mini holocaust.
      Clear Lake Massacre ended in disaster as more than a hundred Indians,
      women, and children were murdered,1852. The Hayforlk Massacre ended up in
      even more disaster, following the killing of a white settler, more than
      one-hundred and fifty Indians were killed, with that they took the three
      last remaining survivors, most likely to have been a woman and her two
      children who were sold as slaves. In 1854 Indian Agent R. McKee plead to
      the troops to keep peace between the Indians and the settlers, after the
      Massacre of Klamath River which was the result of forty or fifty brutal
      Native's deaths. Any Indians who attempted to seek justice and made amends
      for their mistakes were rejected by the whites who depended on genocide,
      or the death to the pleading Indians as the solution to the problem. The
      Fresno Massacre of 1854, began when white settlers attempted to bring perpetrators
      to justice, they invaded and killed an unspecified number of Native
      Americans, this was the effect of the invasions failure for justice.
      Klamath County citizens resolved by killing all Indians carrying guns,
      which most Indians were armed.&nbsp;</font></p>

    <font face="Agency FB">4 Other Hazards of Mining- </font></font>
      <p><font face="Agency FB" color="#000000" size="4">When mercury got into water near the mine sights it would
      form with other bacteria and become an even more toxic substance which
      poisoned the environment and the Indians themselves. the mercury would
      usually end up in insects first, when the fish ate the insects they too
      became infected with the toxin, and then it was finally passed on to the
      Indians, who developed dangerous symptoms and in most cases they
      died.&nbsp; Mercury was used in mining to separate the precious metal from
      other debris. When the white prospectors left the areas they had surface
      mined treeless, it often created floods which wiped out even more plant life
      and wildlife, which in return was killing a lot of the Indians main food
      sources. The main reason for Indians deaths were obviously that the
      killing of Indians was not considered a crime, in fact, it was promoted.
      What drove some settlers to extreme hatred towards the Indians was that
      most were giving and receiving false information and rumors of Indians
      crimes and brutal acts towards whites.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#000000" size="4"><font face="Agency FB">The Native Americans were deeply scarred from the California Gold rush
      more than anyone could imagine other than the people who lived the
      nightmare. The population of Indians was an estimated 150,000 in 1845; 25
      years later and 22 years after the beginning of the Goldrush an estimated
      number of only 30,000 Indians were living. The estimated number of Indians
      killed by new diseases passed on by settlers is around 60% of all the
      Natives living combined. The white settlers killed and sold the scalps and
      severed heads of Native Americans, at 25 cents for the scalps, and at more
      than $5 for the severed heads. $1,000,000 were recovered to the government
      for the selling of these items. An estimated 4,000 Native children were
      sold as slaves to settlers. The prices the enslaved children were up to
      $60 for the young boys and up to $200 for young girls. By 1900, 16,000
      Native Californians were all that survived. The treaty of Guadalupe
      surprisingly had a huge effect on the Indians, as this sent Mexican ranchos with
      new property rights pouring into California, covering some
      thirteen-million acres of the Natives land. They later would play a huge
      role in the California Gold rush. Before 1769, the year the Spanish began
      to colonizing there was more than 300,000 Natives living in California.
      The 300,000 represented more than 100 tribes, all with there own diverse
      and distinctive traditions and cultures, which many were completely lost
      by the arrival of settlers. When other people came to the land, most
      didn't refer to the natural beauty, but the wealth it held within.&nbsp;&nbsp;
