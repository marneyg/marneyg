      Nebraska near the Platte river, which is now North Platte . Red Cloud was
      said to have been very brave and was hardly ever scared. His mom was an
      Oglala and his father was a Brule Red Cloud. When Red Cloud was a young
      boy he was known as a fine horseman, a good swimmer, and a very courageous
      young man. Red Cloud started breaking horses at the young age of only six
      years old when his father gave him a young colt and said that if he could
      tame it, than he could keep it. And he did.</font></td>

      a skilled and very affective hunter when he and the other hunters were on
      hunting trips. It is said that the reason why Red Cloud was such a great
      hunter because he always used his own horses that he personally broke so
      that he knew the horse better and could read what the horse was going to
      do a lot easier. For this reason he always had success. When he was
      sixteen he had already been out on the warpath with his fellow warriors
      twice and he was still a fairly young man when he joined a war party
      against the Utes. When Red Cloud was twenty-eight his father was killed by
      a fellow Ogallala that had gotten drunk and got mad at Red Clouds father
      and decided to kill him. According to Indian custom Red Cloud had to
      avenge the deed that had been done to his father. So, in the middle of the
      night he went into Bear Bulls tent and killed him and his son that was
      trying to protect him. From then on Red Cloud was recognized as a leader
      and started taking part in all of the important decisions in their tribe.</font></td>

      of the most successful wars ever fought against the United States by an
      Indian nation. In the summer of 1867 Red Cloud met with a council of 6000
      tribes at Bear Butte. All of the tribes pledged to stop the whites from
      moving any further into their territories. In 1868 the government started
      putting forts on the Bozeman Trail which ran through Lakota territory in
      Wyoming. When they started going on the trail Red Cloud had a vision that
      the Eastern Lakota would have to move. Because of his vision he started
      launching attacks on the forts. His most famous attack was the attack
      against Lieutenant Colonel William Fetterman's eighty men outside Fort
      Phil Kearney, Wyoming.</font></td>

      Clouds speech, the Sioux advanced upon Fort Phil Kearney. Every detail of
      their attack was planned to perfection. Finally they decided that Crazy
      Horse should lead the charge. In less than half an hour, the Sioux killed
      nearly one hundred of Captain Fetterman's men and in the end they destroyed all of their opponents troops. Instead of sending
      troops to punish the Sioux they sent a commission to make peace with them.
      The result of this commission was the famous treaty of 1868. In this
      treaty, the government had a really hard time getting Red Cloud to agree
      with the terms that they put on the table because he knew that if he held
      out long enough that the commission would give him what he wanted. Finally
      they agreed that all of the forts along the trail would be abandoned and
      the Sioux land would be given back to them. But not long after the treaty
      had been signed gold was found in the Black Hills and the prospectors
      started pouring in which violated the treaty that had just been signed.</font></td>

      stopped helping, Red Cloud realized that he was fighting a losing battle
      but he decided to give it one last shot and go out with honor. Here are
      some words from his final speech. 'I have listened patiently to the
      promises of the Great Father, but his memory is short. I am done with him.
      This is all I have to say.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      them. But the Sioux nation fought bravely. They made absolute refusal to
      being captured and put onto reservations. But in the fall of 1876, all
      hope was lost when Red Cloud was captured and was taken into captivity at
      Fort Robinson, Nebraska. From Fort Robinson he was taken to the Pine Ridge
      Agency where he lived for thirty years. Once at the Pine Ridge Agency the
