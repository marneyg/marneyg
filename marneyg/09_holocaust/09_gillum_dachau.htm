    <font face="Berlin Sans FB Demi" color="#FFFFFF">March 20, 1933 Heinrish Himmler, SS leader and chief of the Munich Police, 
    announces the opening of the Dachau Concentration camp. The camp was formed 
    by members of the SA and SS. The camp is located 10 miles northwest of 
    Munich in southern Germany. Dachau is one of the first camps the Nazis ever 
    made. The first prisoners arrived two days later. They are mainly communists 
    and Socialists and other political opponent of the Nazi party. The SS men 
    wake up the prisoners in the middle of the night. The words of the Commander 
    were “they are not people, they are only second class.” First there was only 
    60 SS men, then it grew to 238 by April 30th. The first murders were 
    committed the very next day after the SS took over by the SS. During the 
    following months of the year 1,933 other prisoners of Dachau are murdered. 
    “Shot on the run” or “suicide” is the process of the SS about their death. 
    Dachau is the only camp to remain in operation from 1933 until 1945.<br>
    <br>
    Gas Chamers were built and exist to this date. Most visitors to the Dachau 
    camp, by the horror to the main entrance of the large room designed as a 
    disguised gas chamber, rarely wonder beyond these areas. The chamber is 
    located next top the funeral room, which in turn connects to the large area 
    housing the four huge furnaces. The gas chambers are small, narrow, with low 
    ceilings. Once it was completed operators would simply open the outer doors 
    and let out the remaining gas and let it spread without risk into the 
    atmosphere were used for this.<br>

        <font face="Berlin Sans FB Demi" color="#FFFFFF">May 25, Late in the night the SS kills a Dachau camp prisoner Sebastian 
    Nefzger, a schoolmaster from Munich. The SS report that his death was from 
    suicide. However inspection reveals that suffocation or strangulation was 
    the likely cause of death. Most of all it’s Hartinger who makes life 
    difficult to the SS. On June 1, he files a suit against the camp[ commander 
    Hilmar Wackerle “because of the crime of physical injury resulting in 
    death.” The debate will force Himmler to remove Waeckerle from his post. 
    Adolf Himmler will order an end to all legal happenings in Dachau. All 
    concentration camps will be formally removed from judicial oversight and the 
    SS will have unlimited authority over camp prisoners. In the meantime the 
    inmates grow worse dramatically. </font></td>

    regulation for prisoners and guards under his command. The orders to lay 
    down severe punishments, including having beatings and execution for a 
    violation of camp rules. Eicke establishes the death penalty on prisoners 
    for acts of sabotage, attemted escape, and political urging in the camp.

    <font face="Berlin Sans FB Demi" color="#FFFFFF">On August 15, 1938, another dramatic change takes place; the old 
    concentration camp, which still had consisted of the buildings from the 
    material factory, is torn down for the building of a SS military training 
    base and the spreading of the Dachau concentration camp. It no longer meets 
    the safety and requirements of the SS. The SS requires prisoners to work at 
    double speed seven day a week to complete the building of the training base.

    the SS completes the transfer of all prisoners in Dachau to the Buchenwald, 
    Mauthausen, and Flossenburg camps. The faculties at Dachau are temporarily 
    converted for use by the Waffen-SS, which sets up and begins training the 
    Deaths Head Division which is a type fight unit pertaining to made up of 
    engages from concentration camp guards. The Dachau concentration camp will 
    resume operations in February 1940. September 3, 1941, SS doctors arrive at 
    Dachau to begin the regular selection of prisoners they judge to be ill or 
    weak to work. These prisoners will be transferred to Hartheim and killed 
    there. Hartheim in Austria, is a killing site, where medical staff gas 
    concentration camp prisoners as part of an operation code-named “Special 
    Treatment 14f13.” From January 1942 until November 1944, SS doctors will 
    select more than 3,000 Dachau prisoners to be killed at Hartheim. November 
    15, 1941, the SS Inspection of concentration camp justifies the defer of the 
    execution of Soviet prisoners of War (POWs) in Dachau and other 
    concentration camps if SS doctors certify to their fitting for work. In 
    light of the severe labor shortages in Germany the SS decides to alter the 
    Commissar Order, which required the Soviet political commissars and other 
    officials. The German Army turned tens of thousands of Soviet prisoners for 
    forced labor, it continues executing Soviet POWs will be transferred to 
    Dachau between Fall of camp. June 3, 1942, almost 60 Polish priests and 
    monks arrive at Dachau from the Auschwitz camp in occupied Poland, are 
    imprisoned in Dachau during the camps existence. The Germans attempt to 
    undermine the leadership of the catholic church in Poland as part of their 
    plan to Germanize occupied Poland. The SS holds Catholic clergy together in 
    Barrack 26, the so-called “Priest Barracks” in Dachau.<br>

    April 26, 1945, just three days before the liberation of the Dachau camp, 
    the SS forces about 7,000 prisoners on a death march from south of Dachau to 
    Tegernsee. During the six day death march the SS shoots anyone who cannot 
    keep up or continue. Many others die of exposure, hunger, and exhaustion. 
    The surviving prisoners will arrive in Teensier on May 02, where American 
    forces free them.<br>
