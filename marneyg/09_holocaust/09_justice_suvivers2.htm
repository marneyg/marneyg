        <td width="50%" style="border-style: none; border-width: medium">The 
        Germans were told that the Jews were horrible people and deserved to be 
        killed. That’s why they were so cruel to them. German soldiers would 
        often parade down the streets looking for Jews. So all the Jews would 
        have to hide so they wouldn’t get captured.<br>
        If they were captured they would be put to work or murdered. They would 
        work in trenches or do the hard jobs in the cities. If they were sick 
        they would be sent to death camps or put to work until they died.<br>
        Or they would be gassed in the chambers. The Germans would just kill the 
        Jews and after they died they would continue to beat up on them. Then 
        they would just toss the dead Jews into a pit or pile them up and set 
        them on fire or they just left them in the street. Jews would be called 
        out into the streets and usually got shot so they would have to hide. So 
        you wouldn’t get killed unless you were discovered. <br>
        <br>
        During the walks to different camps a group would be taken out of the 
        group and shot or beaten either way it was brutal. At the camps there 
        were many guard towers surrounding it. If a German did not like a Jew he 
        could kill them without getting in trouble. They forced the Jews to do 
        things that they couldn’t do, and were killed for it.<br>
        <br>
        The Jews were sometimes forced to turn in their valuables such as 
        jewelry and other expensive stuff like gold and valuable stones. They 
        also didn’t get to take part in any other activities such as ice skating 
        and other fun things. It was horrible for the Jews. They were afraid to 
        go into towns in fear that they might get captured. They were also 
        afraid to sleep because the Germans could find them and they would take 
        them to the camps or kill them there. It was hard for the families to 
        stay together. They would hide anywhere they could. If the Germans 
        caught them they could put them on trains to the death camps. On the 
        trains they would have to stand because it was to crowded. If one jumped 
        out of the train and lived they would have to run fast and far and then 
        hide. If they were left in the trains to long they would either 
        suffocate, die of&nbsp; sickness or starvation.<p>Families would get 
        separated and they would not usually see each other again. The food in 
        the camps was horrible the bread would taste like saw dust. So they were 
        staving to death. There bodies were not a good sight to see. There 
        joints bulged out threw there clothes which made them look dead. They 
        would have to share the bunks. So there would be six in each bunk and 
        they usually had sicknesses.</p>
        <p>Sometimes they would get the courage to try to save other Jews. A 
        girl named Alicia saved several families but you had to be strong to 
        survive. If you were weak you would usually die or get captured. Some 
        even had enough courage to jump from a train. Like one guy named Solomon 
        Radasky. If they were lucky to escape they could get captured again. One 
        girl escaped multiple times. Esther Raab survived a death camp. She told 
        people that they would just kill incessant people for their pleasure. </p>
        <p>At the end when the Americans came and rescued them they went crazy. 
        Some tried to climb the fence but got shocked and killed from the 
        electric fence. Even when they were rescued some couldn't be helped 
        because they were already dying. After they were rescued they started 
        writing and telling about things that happened to them. They then lived 
        the rest of there lives they lived happy, But they will never forget 
        what happened to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
