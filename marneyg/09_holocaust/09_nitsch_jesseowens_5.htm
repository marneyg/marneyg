        Jesse Owens was born in Oakville, Alabama on the 12th of September in 
        1913. He was the son of sharecroppers and the grandson of slaves. Owens 
        was often called “The devil’s child” by his mother. He was very small 
        for his age. He moved to Ohio when he was 7 or 8. When he was young he 
        worked hard to keep his family alive. In junior high he could high jump 
        6 feet. He also could broad jump 22 feet. He later on went to high 
        school in Cleveland, Ohio. In high school he could run a 10.3 sec. 
        100-meter dash.</font></td>

    <p align="left">Before the 1936 games began, Nazis began sweeping people off 
    the streets and sending them to concentration camps. Hitler referred to 
    black athletes as an inferior race. When Owens got to Berlin, Hitler thought 
    it was time to show what he could do. Germans were scared to run because of 
    Owens beating them. Owens made the games exciting because everybody wanted 
    to watch him.<p align="left">&nbsp;Owens won the 100-meter dash with a world record time of 10.1 
    seconds. During the 200-meter dash he raced Jackie Robinsons older brother 
    Mack and broke the Olympic record with a time of 20.7 seconds. During the 
    Olympics Hitler messed with Jesse. Hitler refused to congratulate him on his 
    first two gold medals. The day before Hitler congratulated the German 
    winners, which got him in trouble with the members of the Olympic committee. 
    In the long jump Owens fouled on his first two attempts. The first one was 
    just a practice jump run where he ran right threw the pit, but the German 
    officials counted it as a jump. Owens Olympics came to an end after the 
    4*100 relay with a world record time of 39.8 seconds. In the 4*100 Owens was 
    the first runner, and before the second runner went the U.S. was ahead by 15 
    yards.<p align="left">&nbsp;Hitler left the stadium again so he wouldn’t have to congratulate 
    Owens. Hitler was happy in the end because the German’s won more medals than 
    all other countries combined. Owens made Hitler take back what he said after 
    he won his fourth gold medal. The Nazi’s and Hitler were mad at the end of 
    the Olympics. Owens was the first African American to win four gold medals 
    in track and field. Germany only won five combined medals in men’s and 
    women’s track and field in the games. In the 1936 games Germany had 89 
    medals overall in all events. The U.S. only had 56 medal’s in all events. 
    After the 1936 games Jesse Owens was on the cover of a German magazine. The 
    Berlin Olympics were one of the most dramatic and politically significant 
    events in Olympic history. Owens stated that black athletes are no different 
    than white athletes. He faced Hitler’s discrimination and other Germans 
    during the 1936 Olympics. When he got back to his America he was a hero. 
    When he got back he couldn’t ride in the front of the bus, because of all 
    the Hitler stories, but he was still a hero. He wasn’t invited to the white 
    house to shake hands with the president. He couldn’t live where he wanted or 
    nothing. Owens used to say that he didn’t deserve any of this but later on 
    he said he did<font color="#FFFF00">.</font></td>

    <p align="left">In his career he broke 12 Olympic records, 4 of which came 
    in 1936 at the Berlin Olympics. In 1976 president Ford presented Owens with 
    the medal of freedom. Owens was a-pack-a-day smoker for 35 years. He died of 
    lung cancer at the age of 66 on March 31st, 1980. In 1984 a street in Berlin 
    was named after him. Jesse Owens is possibly the greatest sprinter who ever 
    lived. Owens was the star of the 1936 games. He won most of the running 
    events, but the Germans won all of the other track and field events. No 
    other athlete could do what Owens did until Carol Lewis in the 1984 summer 
    Olympic games. He broke all of Owens Olympic world records. A decade after 
    his death president Bush awarded Owens the congressional medal of honor.</td>
