    <font size="4" color="#0000FF">Annelies (Anne) Frank was born on June 12, 
    1929 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Otto and Edith Frank now have two 
    daughters a newborn and a three year old, the three year olds name is Margot 
    and is very helpful to this new baby. Anne Frank is in a family of four her 
    mother Edith, her father Otto, her sister Margot, and herself. Mr. Frank at 
    the family bank, Mrs. Frank stays at home to take care of Anne and Margot. 
    Anne enjoyed her relationship with her sister Margot even though there 
    personalities were totally opposites. Margot was the quiet one of the 
    family, and good old Anne was the outgoing, energetic, and extraverted one. 
    Anne was four years of age when Adolf Hitler came to power in Frankfurt. 
    Adolf Hitler’s Nazi party was elected in Frankfurt in March of 1933, Mr. 
    Frank feared for his family so he sent them to live with their grandmother 
    in Aachen, Germany. While his family lived their Mr. Frank tried to find a 
    new home and job in Amsterdam. On February of 1934 his family joined Mr. 
    Frank on his search. Anne started school and enjoyed reading and writing, 
    she attended school at Montessori.</font><p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Franks herd about how the Germans were destroying the Jew population. 
    The Germans were completely trying to wipe out the Jewish population. 
    Call-ups were sent all over saying that the one it was for must go to &quot;work&quot; 
    in camps. Refusing to go is sending you to a prison camp and getting your 
    whole family arrested. On July 5, 1942 Margot receives&nbsp; a call-up, they 
    want her to go to work but to be truthful they want to take her to a death 
    camp. The Frank family knows that if Margot does not go to the camp, that 
    the whole family will be arrested and taken to the camp to either work to 
    death or put in a gas chamber. The neighboring countries of the Netherlands 
    are also occupied so it is almost impossible to flee the Netherlands. Mr. 
    Frank told Anne what they were going to do and where they were going to 
    stay. They were going to stay at 263 Prinsengracht behind Otto's office. 
    Jews had to find non-Jew families to help them hide Anne's parents found a 
    annex to hide in at the top of Mr. Frank's business with non-Jew friends to 
    help them run the business and keep them alive. </font><p>
    <font size="4" color="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anne's parents try to 
    protect her from the dangers of the Germans by them hiding the family in the 
    annex away from all Germans, except the friends running the business. The 
    escalating anti-Semitism in 1938 caused the 
    <a href="09_mccullough_annefrank2.htm">Van Pels </a>to flee from Germany in 
    search of a better life and soon after lived with the Franks in the hiding 
    place. Anne said that she had to squeeze into two vests, three pairs of 
    pants, a shirt, a jacket, a summer coat, two pairs of stalkings, lace-up 
    shoes, a wooly cap, and a scarf before leaving because it would look 
    suspicious if they took suitcases out with them. The Frank family moves into 
    the annex and feels safe and free until the German Army invades the 
    Netherlands on the 10<u>th</u> of May in 1940. On the 15<u>th </u>of the 
    same month is when the discrimination begins. Anne was 14 years old when 
    they went into hiding from the first time she saw the secret annex and she 
    acted as it was an adventure from the start. Fritz Pfeffe&nbsp; and the Van Pels 
    family eventually moved into the hiding place with the Franks.</font><p>
    <font size="4" color="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anne wrote 
    down every little (and big) thing that happened, in her diary. The family 
    that later joined the Franks was sharing the business with them. The Van Pels was a family of three a mother a father and a son named Peter. Anne 
    Frank's family was in the annex for 2 years and on August 4, 1944 Germans 
    found the annex and took all who lived in it to the camp. Anne Frank died of 
    typhus at the camp age of 15 on the 12th of March, 1945 she died at Bergan 
    Delson camp. Mr. Frank survived the camps when he returned he went back and 
    a lady who had helped them hide found Anne's diary and gave it to Mr. Frank. 
    Reading and studying helped pass the time of the two years they lived in the 
    annex. Writing stories helped Anne show her feelings most of the storys were 
    wrote in her diary. When Mr. Frank read his daughters diary he noticed that 
    when ever she wrote she always started with ''Dear Kitty&quot;. Now all through 
    out the world people can read the wonderful writings of Anne Frank in &quot;The 
    Diary of Anne Frank&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></td>
