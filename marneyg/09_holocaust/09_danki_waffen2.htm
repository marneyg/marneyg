        when Adolf Hitler came to power over Germany. While Hitler was in power, 
        he was building an army that he called the Nazis. The Nazis were a 
        racial group that were building other armies like the Schutzstaffel(SS) 
        who were made to be Hitler’s bodyguards. Hitler soon later gave his 
        chain of command of the SS to his trusted friend Heinrich Himmler 
        because he was the only one that Hitler could trust. At that time he 
        only had two hundred and eighty men, but in 1933 his SS has grown up to 
        fifty-two thousand men. Later in December of 1940 Himmler created his 
        new army called the Waffen-SS, which grew very fast up to 
        one-hundred-fifty thousand men. In June of 1944 Himmler had over 
        eight-hundred thousand men, two-hundred thousand being Hitler’s 
        bodyguards, five-hundred- ninety-four- thousand men for the Waffen-SS 
        and finally twenty-four thousand men for the Death Head units.</font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">Himmler decided that he would fully command the 
        Waffen-SS through his years. The Waffen-ss grew so large they had over 
        thirty-eight divisions each having about nine-hundred-fifty thousand 
        men. Their training that they had to go through consisted of three 
        objectives: physical fitness, small-arms proficiency and the political 
        indoctrination. Those were so brutal that one of the three objectives 
        failed to be passed. The soldiers did not have to salute to their 
        officers they only had to have their right arm vertical from their elbow. 
        When war was coming Himmler had to command three other divisions because 
        the Waffen-SS division was still in training, so the other three were 
        the LSSAH, SS-VT, and the SS-TV to be used to invade Poland and the Fall 
        Gelb. Then the Waffen-SS got to go and fight but they showed poorly 
        because of the emphasis on Political indoctrination than on military 
        training before the war started.</font></p>

                        because of their mess ups with their objectives and the 
                        casualties. Then later they proved themselves that they 
                        are as bad and were capable soldiers worth fighting for 
                        their division. They truly proved their skills during 
                        the Third Battle of Kharkov when the second SS-Panzerkorps 
                        and the SS Brigade furans under the command of Paul 
                        Haussen recaptured a city and werakened the Soviet 
                        offensive, that saving the group with Erich von Manstein 
                        from being cut off and destroued. The Waffen-SS division 
                        expanded into several other divisions being seen as 
                        being elite. These divisions mostly called the classic 
                        Waffen-ss because they had LSSAH, Das Reich, Totenkop, 
                        the multinational Wiking, the Hohenstaufen and 
                        Frundsburg, and the Hitlejugend. Many of the Waffen-SS 
                        despite having heavy casualties kept their reputations 
                        and crack formations until the end of the war.</font></p>

                            weren’t really involved in the Holocaust, there were 
                            only in charge of the death camps. Many of their

                            people were willing to testify but they said that 
                            they couldn’t. When Hitler saw that the Soviets 
                            fought differently so he invaded their country 
                            differently and so the Waffen-SS were involved in 
                            killing innocent civilians and turning prisoners

                            killed instantly. With many Jewish cities in Poland 
                            and Russia the Waffen-SS had more of a chance to be 
                            convicted of some war crime like when they captured

                            Battle of Normandy and then just killed them instead

                                of the Waffen-SS had to find and capture all the 
                                Jews in eastern Europe during anti-partisan 
                                operations. Soon the wholeWaffen-SS was

                                International Military Tribunal and in 2003 the 
                                government of Great Britain said that there were 
                                over 0ne-thousnad-four hundred Waffen-SS that 
                                are retired living in the United Kingdom. 
                                Himmler had an recruitment specialist named

                                Waffen-SS without competing with anybody to be 
                                the bigger man. In 1942 the Waffen-SS also with 
                                their elite divisions had to rely on conscripts 
                                of ordinary German draft pool. And it was common 
                                for excess Navy personnel to be with the 
                                Waffen-SS without anybody testifying that they 
                                shouldn’t be with them. Then the Waffen-SS had 
                                to surrender to the Soviets.</font></p>
