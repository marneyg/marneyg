    <strong>How many people died 
    in the holocaust?<br>
    No one knows exactly how many people died in the holocaust but they do know 
    a lot of people died. About six million or more people were murdered in Nazi 
    countries alone. Even Americans and Japanese died. The Germans (Nazis) 
    killed about one fifth of the Jewish population in the world. Jews were not 
    the only ones the Nazis did genocide on. The other ethnic groups were 
    mutilated. Basically anybody that was non Nazi was captured. And about every 
    two out of three Jews and poles were murdered or executed or killed or used 
    for experiments etc.... And most of the Nazis plan was well thought trough 
    at first (no matter how gruesome or cruel it was) but the people knew all 
    about what was happening .but because of hope they did as the Nazis 
    instructed because the Nazis lied so it looked as if the non Nazi people 
    were going some were better when really they were going to ghettos and 
    concentration camps. Even as they people walked to their death they still 
    kept hope and thus the Nazis have yet another mission and that is to snuff 
    any hope out of the people (Jews, Jehovah’s witness, homosexuals, 
    Christians, etc…) .which brings us to our next topic.</strong></font></em></blink></td>

    <strong style="font-weight: 400">Isle Koch, wife of Karl Koch was one 
    of the most “evil” women in history and that is not over description. Isle 
    Koch lived from September twenty second nineteen o six to September first 
    nineteen sixty seven. One of the reasons isle was famous was because of her 
    nickname. She had many nick names and still does even though she is dead. 
    One of which is “the bitch of Buchenwald” and there is yet another reason 
    for her renowned standing and that is her bestial cruelty and behavior. A 
    very cruel example is ‘isle Koch used a stick to beat the penis a prisoner 
    was forced to show her and then another ss officer asked if he had enjoyed 
    the perverse appointment with Koch”. Isle enjoyed watching torchery as well 
    as dishing it out as you may have guessed from the previous example. Isle 
    Koch was not the only one who watched it. All of the ss wives that were also 
    ss were very perverted. In fact there are documented proofs that as the 
    prisoners were newd and outside for inspection for tattoos, the wives were 
    standing by the barbed wire fence staring at the prisoners lewdly. Isle Koch 
    used to rid through the camp on her horse with food wiping anyone who caught 
    her attention and then she sometimes had household items made from the 
    prisoner’s skin, which was most of the time human skin. She was not uncommon 
    from the other skin made items. Most of the ss had them to.</strong></font></em></blink></td>

    <strong style="font-weight: 400">Ss and their wives?<br>
    The ss or schutzstaffel was the biggest threat .they was never respected as 
    fellow Nazis because they were originally made as Hitler’s body guard. The 
    ss became so large in numbers that they were considered an army in 
    themselves! But it’s not the ss that the people were severally worried 
    about. But the ss’s leaders and officers, and people in the ss that were 
    above average in command and intelligence. One such officer was Karl Koch. 
    Karl Koch was vary notorious officer <br>
    &nbsp;but not nearly as notorious as his wife.<br>
