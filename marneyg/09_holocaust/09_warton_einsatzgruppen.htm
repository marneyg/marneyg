    killings were almost always the same and were handled the same way. There 
    were four steps the Einsatzgruppen followed when killing Jews. The first 
    step was invasion. The Einsatzgruppe would descend on a small community like 
    a black cloud of oncoming death. Step two was the round up of victims. It 
    almost always took place with violence and assault. The victims were mostly 
    loaded onto trucks or marched to the location of the killing. The third step 
    was march to the city limit. This was done to hide the event from too many 
    eyes and for logistical purposes. Step four was the shootings. The shootings 
    were done in firing squad fashion. The victims were forced to disrobe and 
    line up over the huge graves. Most of the men, women, and children murdered 
    by the Einsatzgruppen were Jews. Approximately 1.5 million Jews were 
    murdered by the Einsatzgruppen. A number too big to imagine.</font></td>

    appearance in late fall 1941. The gas van was a mobile gas chamber mounted 
    on the chassis of a cargo truck. The gas chamber used carbon monoxide from 
    the trucks exhaust to kill its victims. Gas vans were eventually utilized 
    along with shooting to kill the victims.</font></td>

    Einsatzgruppen leaders argued that Hitler had declared Germany was fighting 
    a defensive war and they had to follow his orders. The Einsatzgruppen sought 
    to conceal their criminality. Just Einsatzgruppe A had reported that it had 
    killed 118,430 Jews and 3,389 communists. Three of the four leaders of the 
    Einsatzgruppen held PhD’s. Other leaders included an ex pastor and a 
    physician. These would have been considered some of the brightest. In a 
    total war against Bolshevism Einsatzgruppen leaders contended all potential 
    enemies had to be eliminated by every possible means. In practice the 
    Einsatzgruppen had found that most political candidates for liquidation had 
    fled. Victory over the Soviet Union was imminent.</font></td>

    failed as a Final Solution it successfully dealt with the Jewish question. 
    At the Wannsee Conference the Nazi’s decided the Einsatzgruppen were 
    insufficient and they decided to start building death camps. At the end of 
    World War II most of the SS or police leaders who had overseen the 
    Einsatzgruppen simply disappeared or were executed for war crimes. The 
    leaders were charged with crimes against humanity, war crimes, and 
    membership in the SS. This trial was known as the “Einsatzgruppen Trial.” 
    Fourteen death sentences and five life sentences were among the judgments.

    Ohlendorf, the last surviving Einsatzgruppen commander, was hanged for more
