    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><b><font face="Arial" size="4">WHAT WAS A GHETTO?</font></b></i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">The definition of a ghetto 
    is:&nbsp; usually a very poor section of a city.&nbsp; The ghetto was lived 
    in mostly by people of the same race religion, and social background, often 
    because of discrimination. The Germans made a wall around about a quarter of 
    a European city to which the Jews were restricted, even before WWII was 
    started.&nbsp; Not all Jews lived in the ghetto though.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Arial">Life in ghetto boundaries was barbed wire fences and no 
    freedom at all. The police would beat you for  no reason, and they also would shoot 
    people. The Jews made home–made bombs trying to blow down the walls to 
    escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Transportation was only 
    used by the Germans when they transported the Jews to camps, either work or 
    to be put to death. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><b><font face="Arial" size="4">LIFE IN A GHETTO</font></b></i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">The Jews had many hardships 
    and restrictions while living in the ghettos.&nbsp; Disease was a terrible 
    thing lived with daily.&nbsp; Living conditions were horrible all the time.&nbsp; 
    There was no medicine or doctors to take care of them.&nbsp; So many Jews, 
    especially the very young and elderly died. everyone was starving, because 
    there was not enough food to feed them. they received only .4 of a pound of 
    bread, .5 pound of sugar 2.2 pound of jam, and 2.2 pounds of honey. This had 
    to feed a whole family for a day, no matter how large the family was. many 
    people died from starvation. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><b><font face="Arial" size="4">EXAMPLES OF WWII 
    GHETTOS</font></b></i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Warsaw ghetto had 50,000 civilians that were executed 
    during the first war. Lodz&nbsp;  was where the red army was located also a third 
    of the population was wiped out during the holocaust.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Arial">It took ten years to build the ghetto of 
    Theresienstadt. Emperor Joseph the second told them to build this ghetto. There&nbsp; was 80,000 Czech/Jews&nbsp; that were killed in this ghettos.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Another example of WWII 
    ghettos was Kovno.&nbsp; it was located in Lithuania. there were 1800 kids 
    killed behind the synagogue. A memorial&nbsp; is built here in memory of the 
    children. this ghetto had food and wood.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><font face="Arial" size="4">SURVIVORS</font></i></b></p>
    <font face="Arial" size="4">Some of the survivors are still alive, and they 
    can tell about the&nbsp; Holocaust and some of the terrible things they 
    lived thru.&nbsp; One of the survivors is Ludwik Herzfeld who was a 
    microbiologist.&nbsp; He and his family were forced to go to the ghetto in&nbsp; 
    Warsaw.&nbsp; Another survivor is mark Edelman. He was a cardiologist, and 
    he came from polish&nbsp; Jewish family. He was involved in the Warsaw 
    uprising, and a member of the polish parliament. he received the highest 
    honor in Poland, called &quot;the order of the white eagle&quot;. Icchak Cukierman&nbsp; 
    was also a leader in the Warsaw ghetto uprising he used false names, and was 
    continually on the move to being safe&nbsp; and to avoid being caught. One 
    of the women survivors was Zivia Lubetkin she was a female Resistance 
    leaders that was also involved with the Warsaw uprising.&nbsp; A Talented 
    piano player was Wladsyslaw Szpilman. He was a laborer in the ghettos and 
    also helped smuggle weapons into the ghetto for the uprising. none of his 
    family survived the death camp but he was able to avoid being captured
