    square miles and had a population of 1.3 million people. At one time when it 
    was a ghetto there were 337,000 people in it that was 29% of the total 
    population in Poland then it rose to 445,000 in March. the Jews were in the 
    ghetto cause the Nazi's thought of themselves as the master race and whoever 
    wasn't that race was thrown in the ghetto. The Jews meant nothing to the 
    Nazis or Hitler.</font></p>

        the world behind a ghetto in New York .Jews began trading goods for food 
        or selling there belongings to buy food. The daily food amount for the

        robbed without any help by bystanders and they only stopped when German 
        authorities said so. German manufacturers appeared in the summer of 1941. First 
        there was a carpentry company and a fur company and then a textile goods 
        company. That's when smuggling began. They smuggled food mostly and they 
        snuck it through holes in the wall they threw it over and also at the 
        ghetto gates. </font> </td>

    &nbsp;Then the uprising began the Jews used homemade weapons and smuggle 
    weapons like pistols grenades and some rifles or machine guns. there were 
    two groups that were resisting one was the Z.Z.W. and the other was the 
    Z.O.B (Jewish fighting organization). they were first ordered to attack 
    German troops who were rounding up more Jews to be sent to the death camps. 
    total there were about 750 fighters in both groups put together there was 
    about 500 for the Z.O.B. and about 250 for the Z.Z.W. the Jews held off for 
    about a month when Hitler ordered the German troops to burn the ghetto down. 
    And that's when the uprising ended and there were about 56,000 Jews captured 
    and about 7,000 shot and the rest were deported to killing centers.</td>
