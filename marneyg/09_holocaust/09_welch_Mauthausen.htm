      important role. They made up 4% of their population. At the end of April 
      1938, 300 prisoners were brought to Mauthausen to begin construction. It 
      was placed near a quarry for granite and built next to the Danube River 
      for easy import and export. At the end of the year Mauthausen was 
      completed. By the year 1939 the population was decreased by 57,000. A man named by the name of Himmler
      leased Mauthausen concentration camp for 9,000 marks per year. The
      Deutsche Reichsbank lent Dest nine million marks interest free for the
      camp. March 1942, they created Sub-Camps for more prisoners. More and More
      concentration camps were built near Mauthausen for Jewish labor and to
      hold and execute prisoners. The main camps and its sub camps are
      surrounded by electrified wires, walls, watchtowers and
      guards. As these camps improved the Soviet Union advanced. Mauthausen is
      not a death camp like Auschwitz and Mazdanek. It was a Jewish and civilian
      camp if committed a crime. If you get sent to Mauthausen you are either
      forced to work or get killed. Between August 1938 to May 1945 a total of 
      197,464 prisoners came to or passed through Mauthausen. Prisoners that did 
      not work, German doctors used them for experiments and tested medicine on 
      them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

    <p align="center">Every prisoner that worked in the camp were relieved and 
    replaced ever y three weeks. The Jews were forced to climb 186 steps in the 
    quarry with great big granite blocks. The guards would bet money on Jews and 
    see who would make it to the top first. On the way up some Jews would fall 
    back and kill other Jews while falling. Jews wore the yellow triangles and 
    the Spanish republicans wore blue triangles to separate each other. 
    Prisoners worked Monday through Friday and got paid 50PF(pennies) depending 
    on their proficiency . Saturdays they rest and Sundays they play 
    football(soccer). They spend their money at the canteen they built for prisoners. they can buy
    cigarettes, beer and other items, it costs 20 cents 
    a piece. In 1941, they chose Mauthausen as a class III camp. The camp was 
    then turned into a punishment camp. The weak, sick and injured prisoners were put in death baths, where they put naked prisoners under a shower and 
    turn full blast cold water with high pressure and bodies fall over in 
    painful agony. The SS killed their prisoners by hanging, beating, shooting, 
    gassing, hear injections, starving and freezing them. They took other 
    prisoners and electrified them or let the dogs chew them up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <td width="50%">In 1940, 90 Jews come to Mauthausen, and some of them died 
    on the way there. The Nazis conquered France and set the Spanish republic to 
    Mauthausen. June 1941, more and Jews were sent to prison after the Dutch 
    resistance blew up two German guards house. In 1942 Auschwitz was attacked 
    and sent 1200 Jews and that was the most they sent to Mauthausen since April 
    1943, Nov 1943, Jan 1944 and Feb 1944. In 1944 Poland sent more Jews cause 
    the Soviet Union was advancing to quickly. In 1945 Auschwitz was abandoned 
    and Mauthausen got 10,000 more Jews. 23,000 Soviet Civilions, 37,000 
    non-Jewish,6200-8650 yugoslav civilions, 6300 italions, and other thousands 
    were sent to Mauthausen to be murdered. The SS recaptured&nbsp; imprisoned 
    and killed 5,000 prisoners of war. March 1944, ordered every recaptured 
    prisoners besides U.S. and British soldiers to Mauthausen to be shot. They 
    built extra camps off the entrance road to the east, it was built for Soviet 
    Union prisoners. The americans came to Mauthausen and German guards would 
    not drop their weapons because they were scared the Jewish and non-Jewish 
    prisoners would hurt them. In the 1980's the chief stripped four former 
    Mauthausen gurads of the U.S. citizenship.
