          sent to Auschwitz. Pincus had to ride in a cattle train with about 100
          other people. There was no food and it took two days to get to
          Auschwitz. Many people did not survive the ride there because of the
          heat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
          <p><font color="#3366FF" size="4">Pincus remembered at Auschwitz
          &quot; They lined us up in&nbsp; groups of fives. An officer was
          pointing to the left then right. I was glad I was sent to the right.
          The ones that went to the left went to the crematorium and the people
          to the right went to the labor camps.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#3366FF" size="4">At Auschwitz, the officers shaved
          their heads so they wouldn't get as much lice and tattooed a number on
          their arm. Pincus' number was 161253.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#3366FF" size="4">Pincus had been there for four
          weeks. Every once in a while they picked several hundred people and
          took them to Bunno, another part of Auschwitz. Pincus was one of them.
          They put Pincus in a barrack with around 300 to 400 other
          people.&nbsp;

          <p><font color="#3366FF" size="4">In the morning you got very little
          food. Also in the afternoon you only got a bowl of soup, which was
          mostly just hot water. They had to work 9 or 10 hours each day. Many
          people died because of starvation and weakness.&nbsp;</font>

          you had to have a break. Pincus' break came when he met a friend from
          his hometown. Pincus' friend supervised other inmates. Pincus went to
          see him and asked if he could give him a different job. Luckily,
          Pincus was able to get a different job, and it was inside. Pincus
          thought his friend saved his life.</font>

        Fred and his family decided to o to America, but, because of immigration 
        quotas it was very hard to leave. Fred's family had no papers prepared 
        by a United States citizen, so that made it even harder. They was then

        time Jewish males were being conscripted for labor camps. Fred was small 
        for his size so he was overlooked. Before long, all Jewish families were 
        being  deported to death camps. . Luckily, Fred's family was 
        spared. Their immigration number came up and they left for America.

        Europe. He went to France and then went to Germany. He was captured 
        there. Fred remembered &quot;They had us lined up and I heard them talking 
        among themselves. They said they were going to kill us. Yet for some
