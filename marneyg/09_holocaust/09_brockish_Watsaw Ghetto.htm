        October 12,1940, the Germans decreed the establishment of a ghetto in 
        the Warsaw. This required all Jews of the Warsaw were to move onto a 
        designated area. Jews shops were to be marked, restrictions prod aimed 
        on travel by train, and radios were confiscate from Jews and poles from 
        December 1<sup>st</sup> 1939. Many were forced onto the ghetto, during 
        World War Two. More than three million Jews were sent to death camps 
        such as Auschwites. The Ghetto was divided into two sections, the small 
        Ghetto at the southern end the large Ghetto on the largest, which peak 
        period contained 450,000 Jews, was sealed in November 1940. Life in the 
        Ghetto was tough and quickly goes worse. Newspapers from the outside 
        were forbidden, school lessons took place and people strived to 
        continual a normal existence as best as they could. As more and more 
        Jews were brought in from the neighboring towns and villages. Conditions 
        became yet more cramped. People were bribing for food and money. By the 
        time deportations to the extermination camps began, about 100,000 
        residents of the Ghetto had died of starvation or disease. Warsaw Ghetto 
        was the largest Ghetto containing at its height more the 400,000 people.</span></p>
