      gold or silver medal at the Olympics, she was forced off the German

      A hundred thousand spectators seeing a Jew win would've been heaven &quot;
      Lambert is shown in Hitler's Pawn saying &quot; I can still hear that

      was invited by the German Olympic Committee to be its guest at the Atlanta
      Olympics.&nbsp; She turned it down at First but the committee wouldn't take

      high jumper Gretel Bergmann from Olympics competition.&nbsp; When Jesse

      organizations such as the Jewish athletes and Jewish Labor Committee
      supported a boycott.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; once the Amateur Athletes Union
      if the United States voted for participation in December 1935,&nbsp; other
      countries fell in line and the boycott movement failed.&nbsp; One of the
      largest boycott was the &quot;People Olympiad&quot;&nbsp; planned for the
      summer of 1936 in Barcelona,&nbsp; Spain.&nbsp; It was canceled after the
      outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936,&nbsp; just as thousands of
      athletes had begun to arrive.&nbsp; Individual Jewish athletes from a
      number of countries also chose to boycott the Berlin Olympics.&nbsp; In
      August 1936,&nbsp; the Nazi party tried to camouflage its violent raciest
      policies while it host the summer Olympics.&nbsp; The regime exploited the
      Olympics Games to present foreign spectators and Journalists with a false
      image of a peaceful tolerant Germany.&nbsp; Some boycott proponents
      supported counter - Olympics. Like some of the European Jewish competitors
      at the Olympics many of these young men were pressured by Jewish
      organization to boycott said that Hitler's raciest and anti - Semitic
      policies were diametrically opposed to the Olympic spirit.&nbsp; The

      German Boxing Association expelled amateur champion Eric Seelig in April
      1933 because he was Jewish.&nbsp; Seelig later resumed his boxing career
      in United States.&nbsp; Another Jew,&nbsp; Daniel Prenn,&nbsp; Germany's
      top - ranked tennis player,&nbsp; was removed from Germany's Davis Cup
      Team.&nbsp; Gypsies,&nbsp; including the Sinti boxer Johann &quot;Rukelie&quot;&nbsp;

      an event that wasn't even entered for until the last two American Jew to
      the Untied team were dropped with Owens and Sam Stoller taking their
      place.&quot;&nbsp; The rumor for the replacement was that the Nazi
      hierarchy had asked U.S. officials not to humiliate Germany further by
      using two Jews to add to the gold medals the African Americans already had
      won.&nbsp; Glickman blamed U.S. Olympics Committee present Avery Brundage
      for agreeing to the Nazi.&quot;&nbsp; The new U.S. team won the gold
      easily.&nbsp; Jesse Owens had done the impossible - he had won four gold
      medals in one day.&nbsp; All eyes now turned to Hitler. Would he
      congratulate this Afro - American superstar?&nbsp; Obviously,&nbsp; the
      thought of doing so was too humiliating for the Fuerhur,&nbsp; for after
      Owens's second win he stormed out of the stadium.&nbsp; When Owen's
      finished competing,&nbsp; the African - American son of a sharecropper and
      the grandson of slaves had single - handily shown Hitler's theories on
      Aryan supremacy to be totally twisted and unfounded,&nbsp; confirming that
      black athletes could be as good,&nbsp; if not better,&nbsp; than other
      athletes.&nbsp; his stunning victories and achievement of four gold medals
      including breaking three records and tying another,&nbsp; at the 1936
      Olympic games in Berlin has made him the best remembered of all Olympics
      athlete.&nbsp; &quot;His outstanding performance also affirmed that
      individual excellence rather then race or national origin,&nbsp;
      distinguishes one man or woman from another.&quot;&nbsp; On his return to
      the United States he was given a ticker tape parade. The Americans were
      rightly proud of their humble athlete who had shown up the pride of Nazi
      Aryan arrogance.&nbsp; A remarkably even keeled and magnanimous human
      being,&nbsp; Owens never rubbed it in. Just as sure as he knew fascism was
      evil,&nbsp; he also knew his country had a ways to go too in improving
      life for African - Americans.&nbsp;</font> </td>

    <td width="100%"> <font color="#FFFF00"> The 1936 Olympics Games were awarded to Berlin by the
      International Olympic Committee as a choice to show that Germany had
      regained its status among European Countries following its defeat in World
      War I.&nbsp; This decision was made in May 1931.&nbsp; Two years
      after,&nbsp; Hitler gained power and established a regime focusing on the
      racial policies that aimed to purity the Germanic - Aryan -
      population.&nbsp; The Nazi Government idea of sports facilities and
      associations.&nbsp; Observing these policies,.&nbsp; United States and the
      other Western Democracies counties started to question the morality of
      supporting and participating at the upcoming Olympics.&nbsp; The boycott
      proposals were defeated in the USA as well as in other Democracies
      counties.&nbsp; Forty - nine teams from around the world competed in the
      Berlin Games.&nbsp; Germany had the largest team.&nbsp; The Berlin games
      were also the first to be broadcast and televised with the efforts to
      pursue a peaceful and democratic environment. There was not a single
      German Jew invited to participate at the Olympic games except for Helene
      Mayer,&nbsp; who as only half Jewish.&nbsp; They rationalized this
      elimination to the West by claiming that it was not a process of
      discrimination but a fact that Jewish athletes in Germany were not good
      enough.&nbsp; On August 1,&nbsp; Hitler opened the Olympics.&nbsp;
      Eighteen African - American athletes represented the United States who won
      a total of 14 medals and dominated the popular track and field
      events.&nbsp; Thirteen Jews or persons of Jewish descent won medals in the
      1936 Nazi Olympics.&nbsp; As a result,&nbsp; Hitler failed in his attempt
      to use the Olympic Games to prove his theory of racial superiority as the
      world hailed the victories of the Non - Aryan Athletes.&nbsp; German
      athletes won the featured sports of track and field and swimming,&nbsp;
      the Americans dominated.&nbsp; German hospitality and organization was
      praised by the Western Countries.&nbsp; Meanwhile,&nbsp; Hitler already
      had the plan of execution of millions of Jews and the invasion of Poland
      on his mind.&nbsp; With the ending of the games,&nbsp; Germany's
      expansionist and purification policies accelerated.</font> </td>
