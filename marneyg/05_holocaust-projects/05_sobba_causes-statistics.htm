        The Holocaust will probably be considered Historys Greatest Travesty for several centuries or possibly even several millennia to come.  The thing that is most shocking was the fact that several million people died in a very short period of time.  One other shock was that most or even all of this came from inside one single mans head.</td>

        The first that you must always do before you go say that something is a cause is make sure that is indeed a cause and not an excuse.  It sounds complicated but all you do is one simple step.  You take away the problem and if the effect disappeared then you have a genuine cause.  But if the effect remains after you take away the problem then all you have is a worthless excuse someone made up so they wouldnt get in deep.&nbsp;</td>

        Anti-Semitism is a fancy way to say hatred of the Jews.  It was developed by Europeans centuries ago and it is still practiced today.  This monster is almost as much to blame as Hitler.  If Hitler had not read so many anti-Semitist materials when he was young maybe he would not have hated the Jews so much, and those nearly countless innocent people would have lived.  But what caused anti-Semitism to rear its ugly head in the first place?  These six fallacies are the most likely culprits.<br>
        ·	Economy  Jews possess too much wealth and power.<br>
        ·	Chosen People  Jews arrogantly claim to be the chosen people.<br>
        ·	Scapegoat  Jews are easy to single out and blame.<br>
        ·	Deicide  Jews killed Jesus.<br>
        ·	Outsiders  Jews are different.<br>
        ·	Racial Theory  Jews are an inferior race.<br>
        Anti-Semitism doesnt make sense at all and these are the best answers youll find to explain this stupidity.</td>

	Obviously certain things were needed to cause the Holocaust to take place besides anti-Semitism. Look at any problem and there are multiple reasons that it happened in the first place. The following four items caused the Holocaust to take place.<br>
        1.	Nazis  Under Hitlers leadership  had to decide to undertake the executions.<br>
        2.	Nazis needed to gain control over the Jews and especially were they lived.<br>
        3.	Organization of the extermination and devotion to its success.<br>
        4.	Nazis needed to induce a large number to carry out the killings.<br>
        If the Nazis had missed even one of the following things there plans would have fallen down around them.</td>

	There are thousands of documents on the Holocaust, hundreds of eyewitnesses and survivors of the Holocaust and yet a small group called the Reasonists claims that the Holocaust never even happened! How could they deny all the evidence around you and not and not think that something this horrible actually happened?  Quoting Professor Klaus P. Fischer: These must be grouped with the sort persons who insist that America never really went to the moon, that it was all a deception staged in
      some Hollywood studio.  It is also ironic that the people who use no reason call themselves Reasonists.</td>
