    <td width="100%" height="20" colspan="2">Auschwitz functioned throughout its existence
      as a concentration camp, and over time it became the largest Nazi camp
      ever. Auschwitz was more than a camp, it was a prison camp, an industrial center and a death camp. In the first period of the
      existence of the camp,
      it was primarily Poles who were here by the German occupation authorities.
      these were people regarded as particularly dangerous: the elite of the
      Polish people, their political, civic, and spiritual leaders, members of
      the intelligentsia, cultural and scientific figures, and also members of
      the resistance movement, officers, and so on. Over time, the Nazis also
      began to send groups of prisoners from other occupied countries to
      Auschwitz. Beginning in 1942, Jews whom the SS physicians classified as
      fit for labor were also registered in the camp. From among all the people
      deported to Auschwitz, approximately 400,000 people were registered and
      placed in the camp and its sub-camps (200,000 Jews, more than 140,000
      Poles, about 20,000 Gypsies from various countries, more than 10,000
      Soviet prisoners of war, and more than 10,000 prisoners of other
      nationalities.)</td>

      disease and epidemics, punishment, torture, and criminal medical
      experiments. Auschwitz has become a symbol of terror, genocide, and the
      holocaust. It was established by the Nazis in 1940, in the suburbs of the
      city of Oswiecim which, like other parts of Poland, was occupied by the
      Germans during the second World War. The name of the city of Oswiecim was
      changed to Auschwitz, which became the name of the camp as well.</td>

      imprisoned and died in the camp. Afterwards, Soviet prisoners of war,
      Gypsies, and people of other nationalities were also incarcerated there.
      Beginning in 1942, the camp became the the site of the greatest mass
      murder in the history of humanity, which was committed against the
      European jews as part of Hitler's plan&nbsp;for the destruction of that
