            chambers in Baracke X. Later they also made four more gas chambers
            located on the south side of the southern side of the building.
            These four gas chambers were precisely&nbsp; made and constructed to
            be able to release the gas into the chamber and clean it when it was
            done. These four new gas chambers were used to kill the lice-borne
            typhus on the clothing, bedding, and blankets of the prisoners. Too
            much Zyklon B was being used to kill the lice, so they made many
            small heat able chambers to be used with the 200 gram tin of Zyklon
            B. Heating the chambers to over thirty degrees centigrade helped the
            gas to evaporate from the grains more quickly and shortened the time
            to kill the lice to one hour. They connected the chambers where they
            would kill the lice to the chambers where they would kill people.
            Prisoners would walk through the disinfecting chamber and the lice
            on them and their clothes would be killed. Then they would take
            their clothes off and walk into the other chambers where it looked
            like they were going to take showers because of the fake shower
            heads on the ceiling ,but the shower heads would let out gas and
            kill them. It took only 0.3 grams of hydrogen cyanide per cubic
            meter to kill prisoners.</td>

      built in 1940.&nbsp;They were located on the northwest corner of the camp.
      These ovens were called crematoriums . Crematoriums were kept in a wooden
      shed and were surrounded by trees. It is hard to see these crematoriums
      from the camp. The site is sealed off by the camp wall, a barbed wire
      fence , and a large ditch with running water. The crematoriums were
      designed to burn one body at a time. These crematoriums had long cycles to
      go through which took up a lot of time, so they made new ovens called
      incinerators. New bodies could be fed through incinerators as the old
      ovens were consumed. The cost of the new ovens were a lot cheaper and more
      affective. these new ovens could hold up to 7 or 8 bodies at a time.</td>
