      lot longer then most&nbsp; people realize, played a important part in
      Hitler's and the Nazis Final Solution.&nbsp; Even thought most of Europe

      places to live in.&nbsp; Ghettoes were in European city's&nbsp; they were
      there to separate the Jews from the Christian population.&nbsp; The Nazis
      used the ghettoes as a way to keep the Jews in one place.&nbsp; Containing
      Jews in the ghettoes was not Hitler's idea.&nbsp; For a long time the Jews
      had faced persecution.&nbsp; They were forced to live in designated areas.
      The Nazis established a total of 356 ghettoes in Poland. </td>

      horrible conditions many ghetto dwellers resisted dehumanization (being
      less human, easy to kill).&nbsp; Education was still very important.&nbsp;
      Parents still taught all their children even thought it was illegal.&nbsp;
      The Nazis finally came up with the Final Solution.&nbsp; In 1942 after the
      Wanssee conference.&nbsp; There was one ghetto called the Warsaw
      ghetto.&nbsp; it was located in Warsaw Poland.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

      The estimate&nbsp; 2.1 to 2.5 million were killed by gas, and about
      330,000 were deaths from other causes.&nbsp; At Birkeny &quot;only&quot;
      160,00 Jews were killed.&nbsp; In Jan 1945, Germans evacuated 58,000 prisoners
      who couldn't walk.&nbsp; Not a lot expected to live thought that.&nbsp;

      lives.&nbsp; Sometimes all you had to do to be a rescuer was leave food by
