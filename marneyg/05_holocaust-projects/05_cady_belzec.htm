      built in Poland, as a part of the Aktion Reinhard Program.&nbsp; The Nazis
      built Belzec to exterminate the entire race of Jews and Gypsies located in
      Eastern Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The program Aktion Reinhard was originally
      named after Reinhold Heydrich.&nbsp; Adolph Hitler and Heinrich Himmler
      were the ones that came up with the idea of the operation.&nbsp; Operation
      Reinhard was issued as a new way of mass murder. Himmler replaced the mobile
      killing units with death factories and gas chambers.&nbsp; Gas chambers
      were first used in March of 1942.&nbsp; Belzec started out as a labor camp
      in April 1940.</b></font></td>

      During the time Belzec as opened to the time it was closed, over 80,000 Jews
      were killed.&nbsp; The S.S. officers would split the thousand of people
      into groups. The different groups would be put to death in different ways.
      Jews were told to stand out in a line and be prepared to get shot. The
      people at the end of the line had to se family members get shot while
      awaiting their death also. Jews wee forced to run through a small forest
      where the Nazis would hid in and force the Jews to run through the forest
      and they were going to get shot.&nbsp; Also Jews were force to do labor,
      then were killed in numerous ways. For example, many Jews and Gypsies were told to dig a ditch and would soon
      be buried alive.&nbsp;
      Many Jews were also forced t dig a big ditch, and about 60 Jews at a time
      were told to lie down and a S.S. officer would toss a hand grenade.&nbsp;
      Body parts would fly everywhere, and strong Jewish men were forced to
      remove the corpses.&nbsp;</b></font></td>

    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><b>Christian Wirth was born in November 1885, and was trained
      as a kid to be&nbsp; an officer.&nbsp; He was the first commander of
      Belzec. Wirth served in&nbsp; World War 1 where he was awarded a medal for
      his bravery.&nbsp; Hitler called Wirth to start the gas chambers because
      Wirth would supply the gas chambers with carbon monoxide.&nbsp; As the
      Jews came into the camp on a train, Wirth would speak to them all and he
      had tricked them into thinking they were in a transit camp.&nbsp; The Jews
      ere not to know that later in this camp they would be tortured or brutally&nbsp;
      killed.&nbsp; Wirth, like Hitler, treated the S.S. officers horribly.&nbsp;
      Here is what one of Wirth's S.S. officers Werner Dubois said, &quot; Wirth
      was more than brutal, in my opinion his brutality was grounded more in his
      human nature than in his mentality.&nbsp; He bellowed, screamed and hit
      members of the German garrison in the face.&nbsp; There was no one at camp
      Belzec not afraid of Wirth.&quot;&nbsp; Wirth disappeared in June of ,1942
      and went to Berlin.&nbsp; Since Wirth ran away, Gottieb Hering&nbsp; soon
      took over Belzec. Hitler and Wirth made all German soldiers make a promise
      to them before the operation began.&nbsp; This promise read,&quot; I
      promise to keep my word to the best of my ability.&nbsp; I understand that
      after completion of my service this oath will still apply.&quot;&nbsp; The
      Belzec camp was close in the spring of 1943.&nbsp; A year later Wirth was
      killed in a street fight in Yugoslavia.</b></font></td>

      torture at camp.&nbsp; One of the survivors said of Wirth,&quot; he was a
      tall, broad shouldered man in his middle forties with a vulgar face.&nbsp;
      He was a born criminal, the extreme beast.&quot; The Nazis believed that

      Belzec.&nbsp; Finally the camp closed in the Spring of 1943.</b></font></td>
