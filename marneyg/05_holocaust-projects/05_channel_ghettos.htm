      to extermination camps where they were killed. during WW2, Jews were
      forced to live in ghettos.&nbsp; The first ghetto was set up in Piotrkow,
      Poland in 1939.&nbsp; The death rate was very high due to starvation and
      disease.&nbsp; The Warsaw Ghetto was Europe's largest ghetto. It housed
      about 445,000 Jews. It functioned as a transition before the Jews were
      deported to their deaths.&nbsp;&nbsp; The smallest ghetto housed about
      3,000 people.&nbsp; Lodz, the second largest, held about 160,000
      people.&nbsp; Despite heroic efforts, all but about 2,000 of Warsaw's Jews
