      camps.&nbsp; It was a symbol of terror and genocide.&nbsp; Polish
      government has maintained the site as a memorial.&nbsp; Only a few
      barracks remain, but are now being&nbsp; restored. It isn't a very
      pleasant site, but is the largest, most lethal and dangerous.&nbsp; It was
      set in Poland for three reasons. First, it has the largest concentration
      of Jews in Europe.&nbsp; Second, Himmler knew even under Nazi control ,
      this operation couldn't be carried out so they didn't want it in
      Germany.&nbsp; Third, Poland has a long history of anti-Semitism and
      Germans counted on help from them.</td>

      a vermin killer and disinfectant.&nbsp; Jewish men, women, and children
      were killed with poison gas in the gas chambers.&nbsp; Regardless, of age,
      gender, occupation, citizenship, they all died if they were Jewish.&nbsp;
      But the elderly, pregnant women, and children were sent to immediate
      death.&nbsp; After the completion of four crematories with gas chambers in
      Auschwitz-Birkenau burning corpses in Crematorium 1 was halted.&nbsp;
      Auschwitz contained three camps which are Auschwitz 1, Auschwitz-Birkenau
      2, and Auschwitz-Monowitz 3, as well as forty other sub camps.&nbsp;
      Auschwitz 1 was also named Stammlager.&nbsp; It was practically in the
      center of German occupied Europe.</td>

      sent to their barracks.&nbsp; Some unlucky prisoners were beaten as soon
      as they got there, not having any clue what was to come.&nbsp; &quot;Arbeit
      Macht Frei&quot; (work brings freedom) is the sign hanging over the
      entrance at Auschwitz.&nbsp; Not all the prisoners at Auschwitz were Jews.
      Diaries, diplomas, and family photographs were burned.&nbsp; Not only did
      the Germans want to get rid of the Jews, they wanted to destroy the
      remnants of when they were there.&nbsp; During World War 2 only one man
      managed to get prisoners out of Auschwitz and that was Oscar Shindler. Out
      of everyone's belongings from the camp they found seven thousand pounds of
      gold, fifty thousand&nbsp; of silver, sixteen thousand carats of diamonds
      and money from forty-eight countries.&nbsp; Escape at Auschwitz was
      extremely rare but not unknown.&nbsp; &quot;Tomorrow Morning&quot; was
      Auschwitz's slang for NEVER.&nbsp; But if you did break free, at your town&nbsp; the Jews were still not welcome.</td>

      dividing&nbsp; the men's camp with a brick wall.&nbsp; But August 16, 1942
      the women's camp was dissolved and moved to Birkenau. i So many women were
      in the camps, that there was no room, forcing them to keep adding
      on.&nbsp; Women suffered more than men in many, many ways. Although men
      and women both went to the &quot;Sauna&quot; there were differences.&nbsp;
      Such as, men had to undress in front of other men, but women had to be
      undressed in front of the men, taking harassment; forceful and humiliating
      physical contact.&nbsp; The Sauna was the first stage of the
      de-humanization period.&nbsp; Pregnant women were put to death upon their
      arrival.&nbsp; The average life expectancy was shorter than a mans because
      women lost shape much faster.&nbsp; Mothers who held babies in their arms
      were gassed with them. The children were prohibited to drink water from
      camp because of contamination.&nbsp; The number of children killed by
      Hitler is unknown and never will be. There are a few.........but there
      were no happy endings- they were all murdered at Auschwitz.</td>

      a long ditch, very wide and very deep and had danger of falling in.&nbsp;
      There were buckets in the barracks but were most of the time filled. So
      there was a rush in the morning to the latrine pits.&nbsp; They were
      forced to keep their barracks clean, yet had no pail or broom.&nbsp; With
      filth and lack of ventilation, contaminated air, caused an even greater
      health hazard.&nbsp; Sometimes food bowls were even used as chamber
      pots.&nbsp; It would be a week before there clothes would be washed.&nbsp;
      Some would have to wait five months for a shower and then share with five
      other prisoners.</td>
