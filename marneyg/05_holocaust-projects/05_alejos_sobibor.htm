    <font face="Century Gothic" size="4">Sobibor was built in March 1942 near the small village of
      Sobibor by a railroad station in the far east of Poland. It had to be
      located in a low populated are because of Operation Reinhard. Sobibor was
      about 1,300 by 2,000 feet or 400 by 600 meters in size. It was surrounded
      by a fence that was nine feet tall and was covered by a barbed wire. Along
      the fence stood several watchtowers.</font></td>

    <font face="Century Gothic" size="4">Sobibor was divided into four camps. The administration
      area, the reception area, the extermination area, and the ammunition area.
      The administration are had an entrance gat, a railway ramp, and living
      places for the SS men and the Ukrainians and also kept the Jewish
      prisoners who worked in Sobibor. In the reception area the Jews who came
      to Sobibor had to go to this area first. They had to undress here and
      leave behind all their clothes and valuables. If the Jews tried to hide
      their valuables or cash they were shot and killed. There a long tube about
      150 meters long that connected the reception area to the extermination
      area. In the extermination area was the gas chambers, burial pits, and
      places for the Jews to sleep and some of the guards to live. The
      ammunition area was built on July 5, of 1943 after the camp was converted
      into a concentration camp. In this area the SS men kept their ammunition
      stored here. Next to the tube that connected the reception area and the
      extermination area was a cow shed, a pigsty, a chicken pen, and a shed
      known as the &quot;hairdresser&quot; where the Jewish women went to have
      their hair shaven off before entering the gas chambers.</font></td>

    <font face="Century Gothic" size="4">Sobibor had three gas chambers that could hold up to about
      160-180 people at a time. The buildings were made of brick and had a
      concrete flooring. The chambers were in the northwest part of the camp.
      Each chamber had two doors. One of the doors was for the Jews to walk into
      and the other one was to remove the dead bodies. Carbon monoxide was put
      through pipes into the chambers and was generated by a diesel engine
      outside of the buildings.</font></td>

          <font face="Century Gothic" size="4">When the Jews arrived in Sobibor they were told that were
      at a labor camp and to go take a shower. The men and women were separated
      and the children had to go with the women. The Jews had to take all their
      clothes off and give up their valuables. The Jews thought that the gas
      chambers were shower rooms. About 450-550 Jews would get into the chambers
      at a time and it would take about twenty to thirty minutes for all of the
      Jews to die. While the Jews were dying inside of the chambers the Nazis
      set loose geese outside the chambers so the Jews in line to take
      &quot;showers&quot; couldn't hear the screams of those that were in the
      chambers.</font></td>

      the camp staff and the processing of the victims. The work teams worked in
      the gas chambers and burial pits. They had to clean out the chambers and
      take out any gold teeth from the dead bodies and then push the bodies in
      trolleys towards the burial pits. The Jews also had to work in the shaving
      hut, the undressing rooms, and the sorting sheds.&nbsp; </font> </td>

      The gas chambers were not the only way to kill the Jews. Some of the SS
      men gave Jews umbrellas and pushed them off roof tops like parachuting.
      Other SS men stabbed the Jews in their back with small knives while the
      Jews were bent over working. Babies were thrown in garbage pans or torn
      apart down the middle by their legs. To get the Jews into the chambers the
      SS men had a dog named Barry that was trained to bite Jews while they were
      naked. The older and sicker Jews were told that they were being taken to
      get medical treatment but instead they were throw in ditches where they
      were shot.</font></td>

    <font face="Century Gothic" size="4">In February of 1943 Himmler visited the camp and ordered it
      to be changed into a concentration camp. After that the Jewish workers
      planned to escape. The escape was led by Leon Feldhendler. He was later
      partnered with Alexander Pechersky, a Jewish officer and Red Army POW. The
      escape plan happened on October 14, 1943. Eleven SS men and several
      Ukraine guards were killed. Of the three hundred Jews that escaped most of
      them were killed in the mine fields or were hunted down and killed by
      guards. Only fifty Jewish workers lived till the end of the war. After the
      revolt Himmler decided not to turn Sobibor into a concentration camp and
      ordered the camp to be destroyed.&nbsp; </font>
