      the scapegoat of all of Germany's economic and social problems.&nbsp; The
      country grows more and more anti-semitism.&nbsp; In 1933, Adolf Hitler
      became Chancellor.&nbsp; Anne's father and mother no longer felt
      safe.&nbsp; Otto and Edith decided to leave Germany.&nbsp; in the summer
      of 1933, Otto went to the Netherlands.&nbsp; While Anne and Margot stayed
      with their Grandmother Hollander.&nbsp; On May 10,1940, the German army
      invaded the Netherlands.&nbsp; Until that time, the Frank family felt free
      and safe.&nbsp; Discrimination became evident as the Jewish people could
      no longer own their own businesses.&nbsp; Jewish children had to go to
      Jewish schools, and all the Jews had to wear the yellow star of David on
      their clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jews had to hand in their bikes.&nbsp;
      Further more, they were banned from the trams and had to be indoors by
      8:00 PM.&nbsp; They were not allowed to drive and could only shop between
      3:00 and 5:00 PM.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

      them were the eight people from the Secret Annex.&nbsp; The men and women
      were separated and the doctors divided the people into two groups: the

      building where the Secret Annex is.&nbsp; On may 3,1946, the Anne Frank
      house officially opened.&nbsp; The Secret Annex is a museum.&nbsp; Otto
      Frank devoted himself to human rights and achieving mutual respect.&nbsp;
