      oldest of three sons and to be son of&nbsp; Karl and Walburga.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Josef was very intelligent and well known in the town.&nbsp; 1930 he
      graduated from the gym.&nbsp; When he turned only 26 he started at the Nazi
      youth camp.&nbsp; Only one year later he became a SS troop.&nbsp; 1942 the
      SS troop (Josef Mengele) was injured and said to be unfit for the SS troop
      team.&nbsp; After that he volunteered to be a worker at the Nazi death
      camp, and that's how he got the name Angel of Death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></blink></td>

      was a bad idea to stay and do those experiments on twins, dwarfs, giants,
      and&nbsp; many more.&nbsp; Every day all he did was kill people or decide whether
      they lived or worked hard labor sometimes even if he would perform
      experiments on them.&nbsp; There was one mother who bit and scratched the
      SS men so her daughter would not leave her.&nbsp; Mengele then just drew
      his gun and shot both the mother and daughter on the spot.&nbsp; later
      after the war some twins were found and recognized Mengele as the sweet
      man that gave them sugar cubes and chocolate.&nbsp; The death factories
      were also known to have many diseases.&nbsp; The place he always wanted to
      live at Argentina he finally received a chance to move there.&nbsp; 3
      years earlier the Russians had found 650 victims of Josef Mengele's
      experiments.&nbsp; Also during those 3 years Mengele had a slight run in
      with U.S. troops he thought it would be only time before they would unmask
      there true identity.&nbsp; Later that year he was released.&nbsp; he was
      then reduced from a people picker to a potato picker. although this was
      pretty bad it kept his identity safe.&nbsp; 1946 Mengele had been convinced
      that the U.S. troops had given up on finding him. He finally realized that
      the U.S. troops had given up search on him otherwise they would of already
      found him.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></blink><font face="Batang" size="4">

      all local police.&nbsp; the big reason that helped him decide to move to Argentina
      was that many people there believed in Nazism.&nbsp; In 1948 his son got

      would not give up so easily. they sent out agents to track him down.&nbsp;
