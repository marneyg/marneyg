      Sobibor was one of the Nazis' best kept secrets.&nbsp;
      Sobibor was only open for 18 months ,and about 260,000 men, women, and
      children were killed.&nbsp; At least 350 Jews survived the camp.&nbsp;
      Sobibor was kept a secret because, there would be times when they let some
      Jews be in charge of the other Jews.&nbsp; The Jews that were in charge
      were called Kapos and they beat the Jews with whips.&nbsp; The Kapos would
      sometimes impersonate the SS men.&nbsp; Sobibor was one of three death
      camps that were part of the Aktion Reinhard plan.&nbsp; The construction
      of Sobibor had begun in March 1942.&nbsp; The Sobibor death camp gas
      chambers were ready and a test using about 250 Jews that were from Krychow
      Labor Camp proved them operational.&nbsp; The Nazis' had used carbon&nbsp;
      monoxide gas.</td>
