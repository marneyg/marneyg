      see which camp they would be sent to.&nbsp; After about a day or two, a
      train would come not with passenger cars, but cattle cars to transport the
      Jews.&nbsp; Abraham Goldfarb, a survivor of Treblinka says this: &quot;The
      Germans forced 150-200 Jews into a freight car designed for sixty or
      seventy. &quot; The cars were closed from the outside with boards.&nbsp;
      Water and food were not provided to the Jews.&nbsp; At Treblinka the
      welcome was rough, the torture of millions of Jews and other victims began
      long before they reached the camps.&nbsp; Many people did not survive.
      Before Jews were sent to death camps they were concentrated in ghettos.
      The Judenrate were the people who chose the strongest to go to the labor
      camps.&nbsp; In the trains, people found air cracks they could breath
      through because the train was an enclosed box.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      &quot;that they licked their mothers sweat.&quot; In the winter when the
      trains stopped at the stations the people begged for them to throw snow at
      them.&nbsp; &quot;The lucky ones, who had caught the snow, fell upon it
      like madmen&quot; quoted Gradowski.&nbsp; &quot;They quarrel and scuffle
      about each piece, they raise from the floor crumbs which fell due to
      carelessness&quot; quoted Salmen Gradowski.&nbsp; A survivor of Sodibar,
      Ada Lichman, wrote &quot;soldiers entered the cars and robbed us and even
      cut off fingers with rings on them.&nbsp;&nbsp; They claimed we didn't

      transit camp, where Jews were sent for a short while before being sent to
      work somewhere else.&nbsp; Treblinka was one of the three &quot;Action
      Reinhard&quot; death camps.&nbsp; Together with Belzec and Sobibor it
      served as the destination for well over a million people. As the Jews
      arrived they were immediately killed, except for a small group of
      prisoners. Treblinka was the last of the three built.&nbsp; The first
      exterminations started in July in this camp.&nbsp; In the first five weeks
      a quarter-million were killed in this camp alone. Bigger gas chambers were
      built in September and the extermination resumed.&nbsp; Before the camp
      closed, over 800,000 people lost their lives within a sixty-acre plot of
      land. The destruction of Treblinka began after Himmler's visit to the camp
      of operation Reinhard and they also stopped the headquarters.&nbsp; Before
      the camp could be closed, the bodies of eight hundred thousand victims
      still had to be exhumed and incinerated and other work to incriminate the
      evidence.&nbsp; Convoys arrived from destroyed warsaw ghettos, from other
      places.&nbsp; As SS sergeant Franz Suchonel described it, &quot;Treblinka
      was a primitive but efficient production line of death.&quot; But it
      worked well, that production line of death, 1943, Heinrich Himmler visited
      the Warsaw ghetto, where tens of thousands of people and Jews still
      remained after being concentrated there for the last three
      years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> </td>

      radius of this camp Treblinka was the final destination for almost 2,500
      Jews of Bransk.&nbsp; They were taken by train.&nbsp; Treblinka was first
      established as a labor camp for those who were accused of crimes by
      authorities.&nbsp; This was a quote from Raul Hillberg &quot;The
      destruction of the European Jews.&quot;&nbsp; At Treblinka death camp they
      had the star of David on the shower wall and the Hebrew inscriptions on a
      curtain that hung at the entrance.&nbsp; It read &quot;This is the gate
      through which the righteous pass.&quot;&nbsp; Treblinka started with three
      gas chambers, but quickly expanded to at least six, they were made of
      brick.&nbsp; The chambers at first appeared to be showers.&nbsp; Pipes attached
      to the ceiling brought the gas to the death chambers.&nbsp; Prisoners were
      told they were going to get a bath.&nbsp; Not all deportees were gassed at
      Treblinka.&nbsp; Some were forced to do other labored jobs, but in the end
      they too were gassed.&nbsp; As allied forces got closer, evacuation of the
      camp began.&nbsp; Orders were given to destroy the camp.&nbsp; A farm was
      built on the Treblinka site and the Ukrainian ran it.&nbsp; Visitors today
      are likely to have a powerful and eerie experience.&nbsp; Visitors enter
      the camp the same way the deported Jews and others exited trains.&nbsp;
      Standing there you see an open field with solid rock structures that serve
      as tombstones.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> </td>

      Treblinka.&nbsp; On June 22, 1942, the first transports arrived.&nbsp;
      Jews deported from the Warsaw ghetto.&nbsp; It also has been estimated
      that 850,000 people were killed in this deadly camp.&nbsp; On August 2,
      1943, an armed revolt of prisoners broke out of the camp.&nbsp; Of the 840
      involved only 200 made it successfully to freedom.&nbsp; Of these people,
      only about 100 survived through the end of the war.&nbsp; After the
