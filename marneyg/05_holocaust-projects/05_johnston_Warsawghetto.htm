      of them is called the Warsaw ghetto.&nbsp; The Warsaw ghetto was the
      largest and deadliest ghetto out of all of them.&nbsp; In the Warsaw
      ghetto you couldn't bring food into the ghetto and when you were in&nbsp;
      it you barely got any food.&nbsp; Anyway people died of starvation
      everyday.&nbsp; Living in the ghetto was a horrible place.&nbsp; If you
      didn't die in the ghettos from starvation or illness then you were sent to
      the concentration camps, and they were not any better.</font></td>

      were restricted in the middle ages.&nbsp; The ghettos were filled with
      Jews from the cities and the villages.&nbsp; But before the Jews were put
      in the ghettos, most of them had already been suffering from
      starvation.&nbsp; Many thought that if you can survive the 1st year, then
      you can survive the war, but that was not true.&nbsp; Most of the ghettos
      were established by the Nazis.&nbsp; The ghettos were located by large
      cities and railroad lines.&nbsp; Mainly all the ghettos were established
      before the mass killing in 1941.&nbsp; The Nazis wanted Jews out of Europe
      for life.&nbsp; The Jews lost all their factories, shops, and farms.&nbsp;
      The Jews that survived were let out if they could prove that they would
      leave the country. &nbsp;The Jewish kids&nbsp; 12 and younger had to wear
            the Star of David.&nbsp;</font></td>

      ghetto &quot; remembers Hirsh Altusky a survivor of the Holocaust.&nbsp;
      There was no food, clothes, just pure hunger and starvation,&quot; says
      Erwin Baum, also a survivor of the Holocaust.&nbsp; The ghettos were
      overly crowed by many families, thousands of people lived in the
      streets.&nbsp; Jews died from disease and hunger. While Jews lived in the
      ghettos the schools were closed and so the kids had to teach other
      kids.&nbsp; If they were caught teaching or got caught being taught they
      were killed.&nbsp; The Warsaw ghetto was not only the largest but the most
      uprising.&nbsp; Some Jews were able to escape and join existing
      forces.&nbsp; On food wise they were only allowed to have 184 calories a
      day, that was only 7.5% of the daily requirement.&nbsp; Putting Jews in
      the ghettos was Hitler's ideal of the Final Solution.&nbsp; The Jews were
      forced to live in the ghettos.&nbsp; The ghettos were filthy and were in
      short supply of food.&nbsp; The Warsaw Ghetto was established on October
      2, 1940 and then six weeks later it was sealed with walls.&nbsp; Before
      the Jews entered the ghettos they were searched by the German
      police.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> </td>

      poor, too.&nbsp; The ghettos were a temporary place for holding Jews. The
      Jews lived in fear of liquidation.&nbsp; They had to work for food and if
      they didn't they starved to death.&nbsp; The woman and children usually
      embroidered the Nazis symbol to the uniforms.&nbsp; The office workers received
      more food than any of the factory workers and the people thought that it
      wasn't fair.&nbsp; The people in the ghettos did not have medicine to help
      them get better if they were sick or ill.&nbsp; The ghettos were usually
      ran by the Jewish Regimes.&nbsp; If you were ill or not working then you
      were deported from the ghetto.&nbsp; The bloody history of the Warsaw
      ghetto with Jews on May 10, 1943.&nbsp; The survivors of the Holocaust
      still keep their stories alive ... FOREVER.&nbsp; Over 300,000 Jews were
      helpless and lonely.&nbsp; They could not work in places that they earned
      over 500 zlotys or more a month.&nbsp; The Jews lived in fear because
      hunger increased daily.&nbsp; The Jews decided they should not go easily
      and they fought to survive.&nbsp; They also formed a small army and they
      hid till it was time for revolution.</font> </td>

      of bread a day, 220g of sugar a month, and 1kg of jam and honey a
      day.&nbsp; That did not cover even 10% of the daily requirement needed to
      survive.&nbsp; While the Jews were in the ghettos they couldn't withdraw anything
      from the banks except 200 zlotys (zlotys are what they call their money) a
      month.&nbsp; &quot;On January 24, 1940 all the synagogues and houses of
