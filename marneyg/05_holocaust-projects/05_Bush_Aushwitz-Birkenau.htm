      the waiting disinfectors through the vents in the ceilings of the gas
      chambers down shaft that led to the floor.&nbsp; This insured the rapid distribution
      of the gas.&nbsp; It could be observed through the peep hole in the door
      that those who stood closest to the distribution vents were killed at once.&nbsp;
      It can be said that almost 1/3died straight away.&nbsp; The remainder
      stayed gassed about began to scream and struggle for air the screaming how
      ever changed to the death rattle in a few minutes all lay still.&nbsp; The
      door was open a half an hour later after&nbsp; the induction of the gas
      and the ventilation was switched on the special detachment how set about removing
      gold teeth , and cut hair off the women.&nbsp; After this, the bodies were
      taken&nbsp; up by an elevator and laid in front of ovens, which mean while
      have been stocked up.&nbsp; Depending on the size of the bodies up to
      three corpses could be put up in the oven at the same time the requiring&nbsp;
      time for this was twenty-minutes.''&nbsp; </td>
