    <td width="100%">Hitler Youth isn't a sports club, or a league for
      pre-military training. It's a group that was made for young Germans to be
      able to gain Militarized training and so they could develop better
      understanding and obedience towards Nazi Ideology. Hitler once said
      &quot;My program for educating is hard. Weakness must be hammered away. In
      my castles of the Teutonic Order a group will grow up before which the
      world will tremble. I want a brutal domineering, fearless, cruel youth.
      Youth must be all that. It must be bear pain. There must be nothing weak
      and gentle. The free, splendid beast or prey must once again flash from it
      eyes... That's how I will eradicate thousands of years of human
      domestication.... That's how I will create the New Order.&quot;</td>

      have to carry before God, and the German nation, that I educated the Youth
      for&nbsp; man who, for many years, I considered impeccable as a leader,
      and as a leader, and as head of state; that I organized, youth, just as I
      did. It's my guilt that I educated German Youth, for a man who committed
      murder by the millions!!&quot;</td>

      membership grew to four million people. But, Hitler youth was only founded
      in 1926. So, it took ten years to get to four million and seven years to
      get to 100,000. So Hitler Youth probably wasn't very popular at the
      beginning. Probably the first 2 or 3 years were the hardest. Yet by 1935
      60% of Germany's youth switched to Nazi Ideology. </td>

      von Schriach. Whenever war came into place, when too many soldiers were
      down they sent people from the Hitler Youth. At one of the wars, Hitler
      Youth totaled up to 8.8 million. The resolution of the problem (not having
      enouph people in Hitler Youth) was resolved by lowering the age of people.
      The originally had to be a certain age, now that certain age is lower. So
      say they had&nbsp; to be at least ten, Now they could be say... seven or
      eight. </td>
