      Germany.&nbsp; She was the second daughter of Otto Frank and Edith
      Frank.&nbsp; She was a Jew.&nbsp; Her only sibling was three years older.
      Her name was Margot.&nbsp; The Frank family left Germany and went to the
      Netherlands in the summer of 1933.&nbsp; Otto Had a Company in
      Amsterdam.&nbsp; It sold Opekta, a product to help housewives make homemade
      jam and sold spices.&nbsp; Anne and Margot stayed with their Grandmother
      Hollander in Germany while their mother tried to find a home in
      Amsterdam.&nbsp; Times Began to change.&nbsp; A quote from the diary of
      Anne Frank explains these times.&nbsp; ''After May 1940, the good times
      were few and far between; first there was the war, then the capitulation
      and then the arrival of&nbsp; the Germans, which is when the trouble
      started for the Jews.''</font></td>

      Secret Annex was concealed behind a moveable bookcase.&nbsp; Anne Frank
      wrote of it in her diary saying,''Now our Secret Annex has truly become

Anne’s story became popular because it was one of the only stories that tell how Jews felt during the Holocaust.  Younger people relate well to Anne because her diaries are like reading a friend’s notes.  Anne was disliked because she was a Jew during the Holocaust.
