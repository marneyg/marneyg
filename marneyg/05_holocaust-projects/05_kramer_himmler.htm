      remember of the
      holocaust, but there are many people responsible, one of which is Heinrich
      Himmler. Himmler started started a simple son of a catholic schoolmaster,
      but little did he know he was going to be a complete psycho and the right
      hand of one of the most well-known madmen in the history of crazy
      madmen.&nbsp; He grew up with two brothers and was married to Margeret
      Boden in 1926 and had one daughter.&nbsp; He joined the German army in the
      first world war by being active in the Bavarian Regiment. He may have been
      one of the most terrifying Nazis to ever exist however he didn't join the
      Nazis until 1923.</font></td>

    <td width="100%"><font face="Eras Medium ITC" color="#FFFFFF">In the year of 1925 Adolf Hitler started his own personal
      bodyguard for the reason of he thought himself important enough of an
      influence that he needed it.&nbsp; Soon after creating his bodyguard
      better known as the Schutzstaffel abbreviated as the SS he put Heinrich
      Himmler in charge of it which became Himmler's first step to becoming a
      major power.&nbsp; So just like that he became the new leader of the
      Schutzstaffel which grew quickly as the years grew on and divided up into
      different important sections.&nbsp; The SS was possibly one of the biggest
      if not the biggest criminal organizations to have ever been in existence
      on the face of the earth.</font></td>

    <td width="100%"><font face="Eras Medium ITC" color="#FFFFFF">One or possibly the most famous sections of the SS was the
      Waffen SS.&nbsp; The year of 1940 the Waffen Schutzstaffel was newly
      established, it grew with haste to the number of 150,000 within only six
      months and in four years it leaped all the way to 910,000 men.&nbsp; A
      reason the Waffen SS was made is because Hitler was afraid of his own
      personal army was getting enough power that it might step over its'
      boundaries and do a full-fledged mutiny so Hitler and Himmler rose and 
    spited
      the army with the Night of the Long Knives.&nbsp; The Night of the
      Long Knives was when Himmler ruthlessly used his power to wipe out
      Hitler's personal army, the Sturm Abteilung, which was just too powerful
      until then according to Himmler. Hitler arrested the leader of his army
      and as many as two hundred senior officers and killed seventy-four though
      many argue as many as four hundred died the Night of the Long
      Knives.&nbsp; So with Hitler's army out of the way Hitler and Himmler as
      insecure as they were now felt a little bit more secure and that their
      worries should now be one-hundred percent focused on the war that they
      were fighting together.&nbsp; Since Himmler and Hitler both believed that
      the Aryans were the superior race Heinrich made sure everyone that worked
      for the Schutzstaffel were Aryan type.&nbsp; Heinrich Himmler introduced a
      new pitch black&nbsp; uniform to the SS.&nbsp; In 1936 he Gestapo fell
      into Himmler's hands and was able to put SS soldiers at key posts in all
      of Germany.&nbsp; When the Nazis gained power in 1933 it had grown to
      52,000.&nbsp; Himmler was made head of political police outside of Prussia
      in 1936.&nbsp; At long last and the well known Nuremburg War Crimes Trial
      the SS's dark doom had snagged the Schutzstaffel and it was declared a
      criminal organization and many of its' very important leaders were
      lead&nbsp; to death row as they very well deserved.</font><font face="Eras Medium ITC">

      knew why Heinrich contacted the allies, maybe he knew he deserved death,
      or he may have been sick of the fighting and the blood that was spilling,
      but we do know Hitler caught him with his hand in the cookie jar and was
      going to have him arrested for treason, but Himmler was to cunning to be
      caught and hit he run. He was alright for a decent amount of time, but his
      fate caught up with him and he was to be punished for the treason he
      committed.&nbsp; Himmler was taken in for questioning but, before they
      could get an answer out of his godforsaken mind he found a cyanide capsule
      and committed a cyanide suicide.</font><font face="Eras Medium ITC">

      important and one of the worst roles you could play in a single
      life.&nbsp; Himmler should not be known as a slum because he was one of
      the most ambitious and dedicated men to have existed and to ever
      exist.&nbsp; To conclude the story one of Himmler's famous quotes was
      &quot;Unconditional and highest freedom of with comes from
      obedience.&quot;</font><font face="Eras Medium ITC"> </font> </td>
