      Holocaust. Joseph Sher was a Jewish child.&nbsp; &quot;I would raise my
      hand all day during class and never get called on.&quot; Jews were beaten
      in the streets just because of who they were.&nbsp; Joseph remembers that his brother, father and other
      Jewish men from the ages of 15 to 80 were to go to the market.&nbsp; They
      were ordered to lay on the ground face down.&nbsp; If they raised their
      heads they were shot.&nbsp; Every tenth or twelfth man was shot to scare
      the other men.&nbsp; That day was called Bloody Monday because hundreds of
      Jewish men were shot.&nbsp; Jews had to work they shoveled snow, cleaned
      houses, shined boots and dug ditches.</td>

      3,000 Jewish families in Eva Galler's whole city only 12 survived.&nbsp; A

      the Nazis knew who was prisoners.&nbsp; The Nazis also
      shaved the prisoners heads. The prisoners had to wear a yellow star on the
      sleeve of their shirt.&nbsp; Many Jews hid so they wouldn't be put in
      concentration camps.&nbsp; Many people were afraid of hiding Jews because
      they didn't want to be killed.&nbsp; Before the end of 1939 about 126,000
      Jews escaped Austria.&nbsp; There were 12,000 Jews in Austria in
      1970.&nbsp;&nbsp; On Kristallnacht 76 synagogues were destroyed. 36 Jews
      were killed.&nbsp; 815 shops and 171 homes were destroyed.&nbsp; The
      150,000 remaining Jews who could not leave were doomed to death.</td>

      starvation, disease and anger.&nbsp; Many made no movement towards
      freedom. Many survivors considered suicide.&nbsp; On July 4, 1946, 150
      Jewish survivors returned home to find their families.&nbsp; They were met

      Holocaust.&nbsp; They had to realize deaths in the family.&nbsp; Survivors
      were different.&nbsp; Loss of family and friends was hardest of all.&nbsp;
      The Red Cross kept a list of known survivors.&nbsp; Keeping it accurate
      was nearly impossible because of survivors moving and dying.&nbsp; Sheerit
      Hapletah in Hebrew means &quot;Surviving Remnant&quot;&nbsp; European Jews
      who survived Hitler's final solution.&nbsp; In this group of people
      300,000 were survivors of ghettos, concentration camps and death marches.</td>
