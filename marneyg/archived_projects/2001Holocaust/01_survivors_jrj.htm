      Olga Bitterman, Frances Katz, Paul and Judith Schenderman, Hennery
      Rosemarin, and at least 6 million others who survived the Holocaust have to
      live with the memory and the horrors of the Holocaust.&nbsp; Lets start at

      In 1933 just after World War II, Adolf Hitler came to power.&nbsp; The
      trouble started then with a shooting.&nbsp; The shooting was by Herschel
      Grynszpans. He became crazed about the letter that his sister
      wrote him about how much trouble they were having and how they were poor
      and needed him to send them money.&nbsp; He went out and bought a gun a few days
      later, and then entered the German embassy in Paris, and shot Ernst vom Rath.&nbsp; A few
      hours later he died.&nbsp; That night Joseph Goebelles ,blaming Jews for
      the shooting, went and broke into hundreds of synagogues throughout
      Germany and Austria.&nbsp; He poured gasoline on the seats and the holy
      arks and set them on fire. Fire brigades came to protect the nearby
      buildings but did not extinguish the fires.&nbsp; Thousands of Jewish owned shop
      had broken windows or stolen merchandise. Jews were forced to watch as
      their homes and belongings burned to the ground.</font></b></td>

      &quot;Before being picked I remember that people were telling me that we
      were going to Auschwitz and other concentration camps.&nbsp; But if had no clue

      On the way to Auschwitz after being picked Ben tells you what is it was
      like.&quot;&nbsp; We were rounded u and stuffed 80 to 100 people to a cattle
      car.&nbsp; We were packed in like sardines.&nbsp; They told us to bring little
      belongings as possible to save room.&nbsp; For two days and nights we
      traveled with no food at all.&nbsp; The heat was so unbearable that some people
      died.&nbsp; One morning at dawn we reached Auschwitz.&nbsp; I got numb I couldn't move or feel anything.&nbsp;
      Then the SS men opened the doors and
      started yelling 'Raus, Raus' or 'get out of there, get out!'&nbsp;</font> </b></td>

      &quot; We jumped off as quickly as possible trying not to step on the
      people who died from the heat.&nbsp; SS men stood about every 10 feet
      making sure everyone obeyed.&nbsp; The SS man in charge stood there with a
      grin on his face while he told people which way to go.&nbsp; To the right was
      your destiny to the left was your death at the gas chambers.&nbsp; As soon
      as we were chosen we were told to head to the showers.&nbsp; We washed,
      then SS men came around with chemicals to kill the lice we had gotten from
      the trip.&nbsp; They put it on our heads under our arms and they shaved
      our heads.&quot;</font></b></td>
