      Theresienstadt was originally Terezin, Czechoslovakia until Germans
      gained control.&nbsp; Terezin held the Archduke Ferdinand and his wife's assassins.</font>
      <p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Theresienstadt was established on November 24, 1941.&nbsp; At one point in
      1882, Terezin had a prison for dangerous criminals.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The Jews were brought in on cattle cars with little or no food, water, and
      sanitation.&nbsp; The cattle car would arrive in Bohusovice.&nbsp; From
      there the Jews would walk two kilometers while carrying there luggage to
      Theresienstadt.</font></p>

      Prisoners were kept in small chambers or underground tunnels where there
      was no light or fresh air.</font></p>

      In 1942, 60,000 people were living in a 7,000 limit town.&nbsp; 60,000
      people was not the highest population point yet.&nbsp; Each person
      had two square yards to contain each person's usage or need for lavatory,
      belongings, kitchen, and storage.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Theresienstadt was unusual in many ways.&nbsp; For instance, it was the
      only concentration camp inspected by the Red Cross.&nbsp; Theresienstadt
      was known as the &quot;model ghetto.&quot;&nbsp; People had to work all
      the time, scrubbing streets and buildings by hand, planting colorful,
      beautiful flowers, and painting the buildings various pastel colors.&nbsp;
      Fresh linens and uniforms were provided to the hospital to replace the
      dirty and bloody rags.&nbsp; All sick and old patients were sent East to
      be gassed.&nbsp; Hundreds of raggedy and emaciated children went East,
      too, along with insane people or those pretending.&nbsp; Fresh new
      children were brought in for the inspection.&nbsp; They too were sent East
      to be killed after the Red Cross&nbsp; gave Theresienstadt a clean bill of
      health.&nbsp;
      &quot;Paridiseghetto&quot; was not what it seemed.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Operas were performed, including Verde's Requein.&nbsp; A spectacular
      performance in which Eichmann and other high ranking S.S. officers
      watched.&nbsp; After the performance; the performers were sent East and
      killed.&nbsp; A very young and talented conductor from Prague who directed
      the production of Semetane's &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; went with the
      performers and was killed, too.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Nazis fooled wealthy Austrian and German Jews into believing Theresienstadt
      was a wonderful resort, with a spectacular spa and culture activities,
      theaters, coffee houses, and tricked the elders into paying them money to
      get in.&nbsp; Nazis actually made brochures showing Theresienstadt as a
      health resort, spa, located on a gorgeous river, with acres of fruit
      trees, and rolling hills with wonderful summers.&nbsp; Many requested an
      apartment with a view.&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Theresienstadt was a convenient collection location for transports to
      &quot;The East&quot; (Auschiwitz-Birkenau).&nbsp; The deportation was a
      good excuse to send the old who couldn't work.&nbsp; 1,000 to 5,000 Jews
      were transported a day.&nbsp; Nazis made the Jews pick who went
      East.&nbsp; These Jews were known as the Council of Elders.&nbsp; They had
      to pick family, friends, and many others.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Soon there were not enough room for the corpses of the dead starved
      Jews.&nbsp; Nazis then built a crematorium.&nbsp; It could dispose 190
      corpses a day.&nbsp; The ashes were put in boxes and searched through for
      any metal or gold from teeth.&nbsp; Then the boxes were
      stored.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      When Russians were closing in on Prague, Adolf Eichmann received orders
      from Heinrich Himmler to set up gas chambers and kill all the remaining
      people in Theresienstadt.&nbsp; The gas was delivered and a building was
      set up as the chamber to kill.&nbsp; The Emmandant made preperations to go
      through with the plan.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      They had to get rid of the ashes, so they dumped 8,000 into a pit and
      17,000 into the Ohre river.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The Commandant Karl Rahm, an original tool maker in civil life, worried
      that gassing thousands of Jews would make him able to be tried as a war
      criminal.&nbsp; He didn't want to risk being hung.&nbsp; He decided to
      leave before the Russians came.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Rabbi Leo Baeck watched in amazement as Karl Rahm left the camp.&nbsp; Not
      one prisoner sought revenge.&nbsp; &quot;Look at it,&quot; he remarked
      with pride, &quot;this can only happen with Jews.&nbsp; Of all people here
      they didn't even lift a stone to throw at Rahm.&nbsp; They could have
      easily strangled him if they wanted.&quot;</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Later Rahm was captured by the Allies.&nbsp; He was returned to Prague
      after the war, where he was tried and sentenced to death by Czech
      courts.&nbsp; Rahm did in fact hang, along with others who committed
      crimes in Theresienstadt.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Theresienstadt was handed over to the Red Cross on May 3, 1945.&nbsp; It
      was liberated May 8, 1945 by Soviet soldiers.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      17,320 were still alive but dead because of hunger.&nbsp; One soldier
      wrote: &quot;In their animal wilderness, mad with starvation, they were
      dangerous.&nbsp; It is impossible to mete food to them in the usual way;
      they immediately attack each other, chocking and beating each other for
      every scrap.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      More than 140,000 people entered Theresienstadt between November 1941 and
      April 1945.&nbsp; Over 90,000 were sent to Auschwitz and other death
      camps to be killed.&nbsp; 33,000 or more died in Theresienstadt but not
      one died of gas.&nbsp; Only 17,320 survived.</font>
