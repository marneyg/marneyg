      Himmler is one of the most powerful person of the Nazi regime the&nbsp;
      only person in front of him is Adolph Hitler.&nbsp; Himmler presided over
      the organized network of concentration camps.&nbsp; Europe enabled the
      Nazi regime to get rid of 11 million people.&nbsp; This includes 6 million
      Jews and gypsies.&nbsp; The son of a devout master Himmler started as a
      farmer.&nbsp; As Nazi party police chief devout himself to creating the
      Schutzsataffel (SS) who serves as Hitler's bodyguard.&nbsp; After
      marrying&nbsp; in 1927 Himmler returned to poultry farming.&nbsp; Elected
      in 1930 to the Reichstag as deputy of Wiser Em.&nbsp; He began to get in
      on extending SS membership which reached 52,000 by 1933.&nbsp; He
      organized the Security Service (SD) under Reinhard Heydrich.&nbsp; In
      March Himmler was elected Munich police President a little after that he
      was elected Commander of the political police throughout Bavaria.&nbsp;
      The turning point in his life was his master minding of the Purge on June
      30, 1934 which he pulverized the power of the SA.&nbsp; By June 17, 1936
      he had success when completing his tasks to win control of the political
      and criminal police out of all of the Third Reich, that made him head of
      the Gestapo. In 1933
      he set his first concentration camp in Dachau.&nbsp; With Hitlers
      encouragement Himmler&nbsp; extended the range of the people who qualified
      in the camps.&nbsp; In 1937 he quoted at one of his speeches &quot; There
      is no more living&nbsp; proof of hereditary and radical laws than in a
      concentration camp.&nbsp; You find there hydrocephalic, squinters,
      deformed individuals, semi-Jews; a considerable number of inferior
      people&quot;.&nbsp; From the outset of his career at Reichsfuher of SS
      Himmler introduced principles of radical selections and special marriage
      laws that ensured the coupling of people of &quot;High Values&quot;.&nbsp;
      By the end of the 1930's the possibility of getting this Greater Germanic
      Reich of the future came closer to realization as Himmler reached the peak
      of his power.&nbsp; In October 1939 Hitler appointed him Reichkommissar.&nbsp;
      Within a year about a million poles and 300,000 Jews had been driven
      eastward.&nbsp; Himmler reminded the SS-Leibstandarte Hitler regiment
      &quot; gentlemen, it is much easier in many cases to go into combat with a
      company than to suppress an obstructive population of low cultural level,
      or to carry out executions or to haul away people or to evict crying and
      hysterical women&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b>
      <p>&nbsp;<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FF0000">In 1922
      he got to join NSDAP with the number 14303.&nbsp; One thing Himmler did
      was he desinged secret killing places of instant death.&nbsp; In 1941 he
      ordered a gassing specialist and ordered him to make up and implement and
      program them a pilot project.&nbsp; Each member had to sign the following commitments
      1. I have been instructed that under no circumstances will I discuss with
      anyone outside or co-workers anything dealing with an operation.&nbsp; 2.
      I understand the top secrecy of any of the occurrences of the so called
      Jewish Relocation.&nbsp; 3. I may not take any pictures.&nbsp; 4. I
      promise to keep my word to the best of my ability.&nbsp; 5. I understand
      after completion of my secure this oath of secrecy&nbsp; will still apply
      [38].&nbsp; His Catholicism&nbsp; is no doubt accounts for zealous sense
      of mission.&nbsp; The small diffident man who looked like a banker more
      than he looked like a German police dictator fooled one English observer
      into saying that &quot;nobody I met in Germany is more normal&quot; there
      was&nbsp; a weird mixture at the camps bizarre fantasy and cold
      conscienceless efficiency, Himmler had severe psycho-somatic illness
      severe headaches and intestinal spasms and about fainted at the sight of
      hundreds of Jews (women) to.&nbsp; By Gathering Aryans of different
      religions into Waffen-SS Himmler made the creation of a&nbsp; German Reich
      of the German Nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b><p align="left">&nbsp;<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>Himmler
      brilliant stroke succeeded in introducing the SS.&nbsp; Himmler&nbsp; told
      the SS-Leibstandarte Adolf
      Hitler regiment:.&nbsp; September 1933 he was made commander of all
      political police units outside Prussia.&nbsp; The mission of the German
      people was &quot; The Struggle for the extermination of any sub-humans,
      all over the world who are in league&nbsp; against Germany, Which is the
      nucleus of the Nordic race; against Germany the custodian of human
      culture: they mean the existence or non-existence of the white man; and we
      guide his destiny.&nbsp; Himmler notorious procreation order of October
      28, 1939 to the whole SS that &quot; it will be the sublime tasks of the
      German women and girls of good blood acting not frivolously but from a
      profound moral seriousness.&nbsp; From December 31, 1942 no person of
      Jewish origin may stay with the government General
      unless they are in concentration camp in Warsow, Cracow, Czestochowa,
      Rackham, and Dublin.&nbsp; Before he committed suicide he said The
      Fuhrer&quot; was ordered the final solution of the Jewish
      question.&quot;&nbsp; Himmler told Auschwitz Kommandt Hoss in the summer
      of 1941.&nbsp; &quot;We the SS have to carry out this order.&nbsp; I have
      therefore chose Auschwitz for this purpose.&quot;&nbsp; These are some
