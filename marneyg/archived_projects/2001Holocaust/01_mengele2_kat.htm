            Mengele was so horrid that he dissected a living person’s stomach
      without any anesthetics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another

      <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial Black" size="4">A line was drawn on a wall five feet two inches high once and all
      the kids that weren’t as tall or taller than the line were sent to the gas
      chambers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

      </span>As soon as Mengele found out that an entire block was infected with
      lice, Mengele so called solved the problem by sending all seven hundred
      and fifty women working there to the gas chambers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      </span>The color of eyes caught Mengele’s attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He was very curious how a mother would have blue eyes and her
      daughter brown ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Especially
      when twins had different colored eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Mengele wanted to know what made eyes the color that they are and
      if you can change that color.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      tried several times to change the color of eyes by injecting different
      pigments into a patients eyeball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
      always caused a great amount of pain and most commonly resulted in damage
      to the eye if not blindness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On
      top of all of this, he never did find a way to change eye color.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial Black" size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Mengele also worked on things for the military.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He was worried that an army of soldiers would fall into a lake and
      freeze to death or just run into cold weather without enough clothing on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Mengele immediately became interested in body temperature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He wanted to know how cold a body could get and still function
      properly.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>To find out, Mengele made naked people stand outside in
      snowy weather or put them in icy cold rooms, freeze them, then try to
      bring them back to normal temperatures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This rarely worked; only a few patients would survive the gruesome
      experiment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial Black" size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Sometimes people were forced into pressure chambers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>A legible reason for doing this is unknown.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Many people say that Mengele would be laughing watching
      people be put under so much pressure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This was known as one of the worst experiments Mengele put his
      patients through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many people
      would literally bang their heads against a wall to avoid suffering from
      the pressure. <o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial Black" size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span><o:p>
      </o:p>Pieces of human flesh were cut from fresh corpses and used
      to grow bacteria in laboratories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial Black" size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Mengele
      even tried to change the gender of people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He tried to turn a male into a female and a female into a male.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>There is no evidence of this ever working, and nobody ever live to
      tell about what they exactly went through.</o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial Black" size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>He once supervised an operation where two Gypsy children together
      to try to create Siamese twins.&nbsp; Their hands became badly infected
      where the veins had been resected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span><o:p>
      </o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial Black" size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>We might never know the full extent of the terrible experiments
      Mengele performed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He shipped
      out two truckloads of files and had them destroyed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span><o:p>
      </o:p>

      </span>Survivors, to this day, are still trying to find out the extent of what exactly
      was done to them under Mengele’s supervision.&nbsp; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
