      March 1943. There first commander was Franz Stangl. About 700 Jewish
      workers temporarily to service that camp. They had 3 gas chambers (later
      6). The number of deaths were 250,000 most being Jews. The site measured
      about 1,300 by 2,000 feet surrounded by triple line barb wire fence and they
      were watched by watchtowers. The gas chambers were 12 feet by 12 feet.
      Each gas chamber held 160-180 people. From May 1942- july1942,100,000 Jews
      were murdered. The killing process took about 20-30 minutes. Prossing 1 of
      a convoy of 26 wagons took about 2-3 hours.</font>
      <p><font face="Courier" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between August and September
      1942, the murdering had stopped killing , so repairs could be made on the
      main track feeding to Sobibor. The 6 gas chambers enabled SS to kill about
      1,200 people at the same time. Then they would burrier them. Now the campus
      under commander of Franz Reichsleiter. He continued the operations in October
      1942 and worked through to spring1943.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over this period ,70-80,000
      Galican Jews,145-150,000 Jews from the General-Government, and 25,000 Slovak
      Jews were murdered. March 1943 the first transport of French Jews
      arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> <p><font face="Courier" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Between March and July1943,19 Dutch transport brought 35,000 Jews were
      from Holland. The last months of the ,Sobibor was used to murder Jews of
      the Vilna, Minsk and Lada ghettos. Its estimated that 250,000 were
      murdered at Sobibor. In July1943, Himmler, who had visited camp in February, he ordered that it be a converted into a concentration camp. This
      edict effetely served an death notice on the Jewish workers who then
      organized a resistant movement and worked out an escape plan. It was led
      by Leon Feldherdler. he was a subsequentassised by Alexander Pechersky, a
      Jewish officer in a transporter Red Army POW's which arrived in the camp
      in September 1943. The uprising launched October,14 1943.&nbsp; 300 Jews
      escaped but dozens of them were killed in the mine field around the camp
      and dozens more were hunted down over subsequent days. Of all the people
      who broke out about 50 survived to see the end of the war. The camp was
      liquid at the end of October 1943 and the site disguised as a farm.</font><p><font face="Courier" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      260,000 Jews were killed between June 1942 till the uprising and escape
      365 work force prisoners on the 14, October 1943. After the escape the
      town&nbsp; got down. Only 47 could escape and survive to see the end of
      the war. The people who arrived were sure to be killed within several
      hours.</font><p><font face="Courier" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The camp was divided into 4 different
      sections the pre camp was were the Germans were housed. Larger I was the
      part of the camp and it was were the prisoners lived and were they worked.
      When they entered the gas chambers they were completely bald.</font><p><font face="Courier" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      As though in response to an order, several axes had been hidden in coats
      and were brought down on his head. A few women who were frightened by what
      they saw and began to scream, some even fainted. Some of the people ran
      like crazy without thinking and without any propose. That situation there
      was no question of origination or maintaining order there for I shouted at
      the top of my voice ''Forward comrades!''&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Courier" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      ''Forward.'' someone echoed behind me on the right.</font><p><font face="Courier" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      '' For the Fatherland for Stalin, Forward!''</font><p><font face="Courier" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Six thousand men cried ''HURRAH!!&quot; for life and freedom.</font><p><font face="Courier" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Machine guns were fired and we didn't know whether to go right, left,
      forward, or backward.</font><p><font face="Courier" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We aimed for the forest.
      We walked for three Kilometers over open canal about 5 or 6 meters
