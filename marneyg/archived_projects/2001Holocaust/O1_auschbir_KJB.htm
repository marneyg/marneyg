      others called it the &quot;Gate to Hell." On the day of the 27th of
      April,1940, a man by the name of Heinrich Himmler ordered for a
      concentration camp to be built. They chose the name..... Auschwitz.&nbsp;
      A month later on May 26th,1940, it was established near the village of
      Chelmno.&nbsp; At first it wasn't a very bad place, but as a couple of
      years past it became the center of where the largest amount of Jews and
      Russians were killed.&nbsp; Auschwitz was divided into three major camps:
      Auschwitz I, the main camp, Auschwitz II, or Birkenau, which was
      established on October 8th, 1941, and Auschwitz III, which was established
      on May 31st,1942, as a work camp.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      1941 near the village of Chelmno. Many people died from brutal treatment,
      overwork, or disease. The camps were considered prisons.&nbsp; Auschwitz

      </span>The Germans had decided that the best way to slaughter the Jews was
      poison gas, but shooting still took place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The gas that was used called Zyklon- B, which was already to be

      fumigate the buildings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
      they used it they would shove Jews and Russian prisoners into the cell of
      Block 11, a so called shower room, and would throw the gas pellets inside
      and slam the doors shut.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      monoxide only meant one thing...... an agonizing death. Not only their
      bodies were violated in search for every possible economic contribution
      whether it be cutting off the women's hair to be made into industrial
      thread or melting down gold teeth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
      final resting place was a giant whole in the ground where they were just
      thrown on top of each other and then burnt in a big fire and then covered
      up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other horrors of the
      death camp was medical experiments. Many Jews suffered intensely from
      these experiments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A few of
      the experiments were to support Nazi theories of racial superiority. First
      they found a suitable subject that looked like a German and take skull
      measurements. They would have them shot and their heads were cut off.
      After that they would try to find ways to turn brown eyes to blue by
      injecting them with various pigments. Another experiment was to se how
      long someone could live without food and water. The Nazi’s wouldn’t
      let them have any food or water. They could only have salt water and would
      see what effects it would have on them. Although some Nazi’s treated the
      Jews very badly some were very kind to them. One man who later died said
      “one of them had treated them very well”. “. Frequently he would
      bring us food on the side from the German kitchen”. But others said that
      most of them treated them as cruel as cruel can get.<o:p>
