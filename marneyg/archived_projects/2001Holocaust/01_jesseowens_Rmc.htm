      James
      Cleveland Owens was born in 1913 in Oakville Alabama; near Danville. His
      nick name is Jessie cause of J.C. When Jessie was 7 years old he and his
      family moved to Cleveland. He was the son of a sharecropper. When they
      moved to Ohio they enrolled Jessie in public schools. He had many
      different jobs ; he delivered groceries, loaded freight cars and worked in
      shoe repair shops that is when he discovered that he enjoyed running. In
      gym class they had to run the 60 yard dash. When his teacher saw that he
      was a good runner he told him to join track so he did that was the turning
      point in his life.&nbsp;</b></font>
      <p> <b> <font face="Arial" size="4"> Many colleges and universities&nbsp; tried to recruit
      Jessie but he chose Ohio State University. He excelled in track and field
      while attending college. He also set 7 world records in his college
      career. In college he met some fierce competition not just on the track.
      He was required to live off campus with African American athletes and
      sometimes he had to eat in ''blacks only '' restaurants or had to eat
      carry out food. Sometimes '' white hotels'' would allow him to stay but he
      had to use the back door or stairs instead of the elevator. He was not
      awarded a scholarship to the university of Ohio. He continued to work part
      time jobs to pay for school. And on August1,1936 the Olympic games begin
      in Berlin. Jessie became the most famous athlete in sports history and he
      was a track and field star. While at the Olympics he won four gold medals
      that was a big story and there were several subplots. He won the 200 and
      100 meter dashes and broad jump( know called long jump) and was a member
      of the 400 meter relay team. Jessie embarrassed received Hitler all cause he
      was black.&nbsp;Hitler saw the Olympics as an ideal showcase for glories
      of Nazi system&nbsp; and Fuhrer was on his box seat at track and field
      events. Hitler was also hoping that German athletes were superior to other
      people. Hitler also viewed the Olympics as an opportunity to advance Nazi
      ideology. On the first day of competition Hitler congratulated those
      athletes who finished 1,2,3 in the 100 meter run. German officials
      deprived Owens for second share of the world record in 100 meter run.&nbsp;</font> </b>
      </p>
      <p> <b> <font face="Arial" size="4"> Over
      4,000 athletes from 59 nations participated in the games. Germany and
      Japan were not invited to participate in the games. Owens broke 3 world
      records and tied for fourth within 45 seconds had an ailing back to the
      entire&nbsp; week&nbsp; that was leading up to the meet in Ann Arbor.
      Owens was allowed&nbsp; to race in other events. He was not allowed to
      shake hands with the president. A famous quote: '' I always loved running
      it was something you could do by yourself&nbsp; and under your own power.
      You&nbsp; could go in any direction fast or slow as you wanted fighting
      the wind if you felt like it, seeking out new sights just on the strength
      in your feet and courage in your lungs.'' Another famous quote is: &quot;
      When I came back after all those story's about Hitler and his snub, I came
      back to my native country and could not ride in the front of the bus I had
      to go in the back door I couldn't live where I wanted . Now what's the
      difference.''</font> </b>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Owens had trouble qualifying in the long jump. Jessie fell down a
      flight of stairs and was questionable if he would be physically able to
      participate he received&nbsp; treatment up to his race time.</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>He begged&nbsp; the coach to let him run in the 100
      meter dash. He ran the race in 9.4 seconds which tied the world record.&nbsp;
      </b></font><b><font face="Arial" size="4">While at the Olympics he made a new friend named
      Luz Long a tall, blond, blue eyed, picture of what the Nazi required as
      Aryan supremacy introduced himself to Owens and the 2 athletes had a
      friendly chat. Long didn't believe in Nazi racial nonsense. He
      suggested&nbsp; that Owens simply play safe on his 3rd attempt on the long
      jump and take off from several inches before the foul line.&nbsp; Owens took the advice and qualified. On the
      second&nbsp; of his six jumps in the final round, he sailed 25 feet 10
      inches breaking the Olympic record by 4 1\2 inches. But Long matched that,
      exactly, and the two tied for first place as Owens would win 4 gold
      medals, you would of had a lot of takers because he was scheduled to enter
      only 3 events.&nbsp; On August 7 two days before the relay heats were
      to begin it was announced that Owens would properly replace Glickman, ostensibly
      so he could win a fourth gold medal.</font></b></td>

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>When Owens returned to the United States he was
      greeted with a tickertape parade in New York City. That was his last true
      moment of glory.</b></font><b><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp; Jessie accomplished tasks that had never been
      completed in the history of track- and -field. He was the first American
      in the History of the Olympics to win 4 gold medals in a single day. He
      left&nbsp; school to run professionally( until 1948) so he could earn
      money for his family.&nbsp; After that he started his own Public Relations
      firm. In 1976 he won the highest honor a civilian of the United States
      could win President Ford awarded him with the Medal of Freedom.&nbsp; Another famous quote he wrote before he died was;''
      You can melt down all the medals and cups I have and that won't&nbsp;
      replace the 24 carat friendship I felt for Luz Long.''</font></b></td>

      Through all the trials and tribulations and success, he was a devoted and

      Ruth Solomon, in 1935. Together they had 3 daughters Gloria, Beverly, and
      Marlene. To this day, Ruth and his daughter Marlene operate the
