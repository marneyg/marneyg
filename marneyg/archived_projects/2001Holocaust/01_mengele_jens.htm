      </span>On the date of March 16, 1911 the eldest son was born to a Catholic
      couple named Karl and Walburga Mengele in the Bavarian village of Gunzburg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Karl and Walburga decided to name their new baby boy, Josef
      Mengele.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Josef grew up in a
      hope not seeing much of his family.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Denmark" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>By October 1930, Josef left Gunzburg to start his college degree
      majoring in Philosophy and Medicine at Munich University.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><span style="mso-tab-count:1"><font face="Denmark" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font>
      </span><font face="Denmark" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">The year 1938 was a long one for Mengele.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In this year, the month of May, he applied for membership and was
      accepted into the Schutzstaffel, or SS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It was also in 1938 Frankfurt University awarded Mengele his
      medical degree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The same year
      was the year Mengele had his first experience in military training,
      spending three months training for combat with the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Wehrmacht</i>,
      or the German Army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the
      rest of 1938 until 1940 Mengele remained with the Institute, assisting von
      Verschuer and reviewing the work of other researchers.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Denmark" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>It wasn't until 1939 that war broke out, and Mengele was electrified
      with hope of fighting for Father Germany.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Mengele wasn't disappointed; although he had to wait until June of
      1940 due to he prior kidney ailment, he was accepted to the Waffen SS,
      elite soldiers within the SS itself, and most fanatical adherents to
      Hitler call to preserve and protect the German race.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Denmark" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>In the words of several eyewitnesses, survivors, and of historians
      and psychologists, <o:p>
      </o:p>
      &quot;Dr. Josef Mengele was not merely of Auschwitz, Dr. Josef
      Mengele was Auschwitz.&quot;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      Through his actions and behavior, Mengele was able to embody the unearthy
      contradictions of death camp where arriving prisoners were serenaded with
      Waltz music played by a prisoner orchestra, while a few yards away
      hundreds of people were reduced to ash in the crematoria; a camp where
      affection and comfort were lavished upon the children living in the Zoo,
      only so as to keep them healthy enough for &quot;twisted and pointless
      experimentations&quot;; a camp where Mengele himself escorted his
      &quot;beloved children&quot; to the gas chamber, referring to their walks
      as a game he liked to call &quot;on the way to the chimney.&quot;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Denmark" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The death factory at Auschwitz was a gruesome kingdom of human
      misery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Barracks and their
      inhabitants were invaded with the foulest of sanitary conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Diseases such as typhus and diarrhea were rampant, as were lice,
      vermin and fleas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was over
      this kingdom which Dr. Josef Mengele sought to preside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Mengele's stated mission at Auchwitz was to perform research on
      human genetics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His work was
      funded through a grant that Professor von Verschver had secured through
      the German Research Council in August of 1943.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The goal of Mengele's work was to unlock the secrets of genetic
      engineering inferior gene strands from the human population as a means to
      creating a Germanic super-race.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite
      the scientific premise for his work, Josef accomplishments added volumes
      to the annals of human cruelty while contributing nothing of value to the
      greater understanding of human genetics and engineering.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Denmark" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>While at Auschwitz the established his reputation as a
      &quot;ruthless, cold-blooded killer&quot; whose name inspired fear even in
      the SS officers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
      reputation ended up giving him the nickname, Angel of Death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He immediately demonstrated a deep capacity for wanton murder
      during a typhus epidemic that broke out in the camp just days after he had
      arrived to the camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      ordered a thousand Gypsy men and women who had the disease to the gas
      chamber, while sparing the lives of German Gypsies.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Denmark" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Inmate- doctor Gisella Perl recalls an incident when Mengele caught
      a woman in her sixth attempt to escape from a truck transporting victims
      to the gas chamber:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Denmark" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>&quot;He
      grabbed her by the neck and proceeded to beat her to a bloody pulp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He hit her, slapped her, boxed her, always her head-- screaming at
      the top of his voice, 'You want to escape don't you?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>You can't escape now!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You're
      going to burn like the others, you are going to croak, you dirty Jew!.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>As I watched, I saw her two beautiful, intelligent eyes disappear
      under a layer of blood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
      in a few seconds, her straight, pointed nose was a flat, broken, bleeding
      mass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Half an hour later, Dr.
      Josef Mengele returned to the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He took a piece of perfume soap out of his bag, and whistling gaily
      with a smile of a deep satisfaction on his face, he began to wash his
      hands.&quot;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Denmark" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Around other women Mengele acted charming and sweet, then only
      moments later he sent them to the gas chamber.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Denmark" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>In addition to the selection and beatings, Mengele occupied his
      time with other numerous acts of the most base cruelty, including the
      dissection of live infants; the castration of boys and men without the use
      of any kind of anesthetic; and the administering of high-voltage electric
      shocks to women inmates under the auspices of testing their endurance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>On one occasion Mengele even sterilized a group of Polish nuns with
      a X-ray machine, leaving the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">celibate</i> women horribly burned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In 1981 the Western German Prosecutor's Office drew up 78
      different inditments against Mengele, charging him with the most heinous
      and bestial crimes against humanity.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Denmark" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Dr. Josef Mengele fled Auschwitz on January 17, 1945, as the Soviet
      army advanced across the crumbling German Reich towards Berlin.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>During the first few years of the post-war era, Mengele
      remained in hiding on a farm near his native Gunzburg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He assumed a fake identity, and worked as a farm hand, keeping
      informed of events through secret contacts with old Gunzburg friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Incredibly, he at first aspired to continue his career as a
      research scientist, but it became increasingly apparent that the Allies
      weren't going to let a notorious war criminal such as he simply resume the
      life he had enjoyed prior to the war without paying for the crimes he had
      committed during it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mengele
      finally decided that he was no longer safe in Europe and escaped through
      Italy to an ocean liner bound for Argentina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Mengele arrived in Argentina in 1949.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Denmark" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Mengele was to spend the next thirty years on the run from
      international authorities.<o:p>
      </o:p>Many still live for the day when they will be able to extract
      justice for their suffering from the man who was responsible for so much
      of it, both during and after the war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Alas, Mengele has escaped he sought to wield total control-- death
      itself.<o:p>
