      <p></font><b><i><font SIZE="4"><font face="Arial Narrow">There were 37,000 Jews living in Warsaw, as
      many as in all of France, and in the whole country of Czechoslovakia. Only
      New York had a larger population then Warsaw until the Warsaw Ghetto.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial Narrow">In 1939 the Warsaw Ghetto was established. It was established in a
      sixteen by sixteen area of the city. The Ghetto was divided into two
      sections, the Small Ghetto at the southern end and the Large Ghetto on the
      North. The Germans stormed the city in a three weeks siege. The Poles put
      up a good fight for those three weeks, but the Germans had more people,
      fire power, and means to take over Warsaw.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="01_PIC3_AMF.jpg" width="731" height="224"></p>
      <p><font face="Arial Narrow">In the Warsaw Ghetto the conditions were nearly unbearable. Buildings
      and apartments were run down by rats and bugs. Hunger is what many people
      suffered from. Many Germans picked on the Jews for the fun of it. They
      would take there things, and they would cut there hair, and even beat
      them. The Ghettos purpose was to contain the Jews before they were sent to
      death or concentration camps and to keep them away from regular society.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial Narrow">Adam Czerniako chairman of the Warsaw Jewish Council, was ordered to
      deliver 6,000 Jews per day, seven days a week, to the Umschlagplatz for
      deportation to Treblinka by Eastern border of Poland. A day later the
      number was increased to 7,000 per day. Rather then helping the Germans, he
      committed suicide on July 22, 1942 the very day the Jews were assembled
      and ready for deportation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial Narrow">During 1942 300,000 Ghetto residents died, some in the Ghetto died of
      disease, or starvation. Most of the Jews were sent to death camps or
      concentration camps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="01_PIC2_AMF.jpg" width="100" height="70"></p>
      <p><font face="Arial Narrow">By April of 1943, there were only 60,000 Jews left in the Ghetto,
      spared from the death camps. On April 14 1943 the Jews attacked nearly
      unarmed with little ammo and sparse training. The Jews attacked because
      they received reports about massive killing at the extermination or death
      camps and news about of a plan to deport the last of the Jewish people
      living in the Ghetto in the near furture. There were about 60,000 people
      including some 750 armed fighters who had but a few guns witch they built
      themselves. They had refused to obey the powerful SS as demanded. Gestapo
      and Wehrmacht sent troops into the Ghetto to put a stop to the uprising of
      these desperate people with unrelenting force. The head of the SS,
      Heinrich Himmler, ordered the whole entire Warsaw Ghetto to be blew up. On
      May 16th, 1943 the revolt was put down, the district was almost completely
      destroyed. 7,000 people got shot by the SS, about 50,000 remaining Jews
      were deported to the Majdanek and Treblinka extermination of death camps.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial Narrow">&quot;The last wish of my life has been fulfilled. Jewish self-defense
      has become a fact. Jewish resistance and revenge have become actualities.
      I am happy to have been one of the first Jewish fighters in the
      Ghetto.&quot;</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial Narrow">The Zionist ha-Shomer ha-Tsa'ir movement was lead by the Warsaw native
      Mordecai Anielewicz. He was a full time underground activist by January
      1940. When word began to spread a little after June of 1941 about the mass
      killing being carried out by the Nazis, Anielewicz concentrated on the
      creation of a self-defense organization in the Ghetto. 1942, after the
      mass deportation. Anielewicz took over and reorganized the ZOB (Jewish
      Fighting Organization), and in November 1942 he was appointed the
      commander.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial Narrow">During the first days of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Anielewicz,
      twenty-three years old, was in command, When the streets fighting ended,
      he and his staff and a large force of fighters retreated to a bunker at 18
      Mila Street. The bunker fell on May 8, 1943, and Mordecai Anielewicz was
      killed.</font></p>
