    <td width="100%" colspan="2">Julius Streicher was born in Augsburg, Bavaria, 1885. He became an elementary school
      teacher in his hometown.&nbsp; He fought&nbsp; in World War One and was
      awarded many medals for his duty in combat.&nbsp; Through the years,
      Streicher became known as &quot;Jew-Baiter Number One,&quot; because he
      believed the Aryan race is the superior race.&nbsp; He followed Hitler and believed Adolf's prophecies would come
      true one day.&nbsp; Streicher became the Obergruppenfurhrer (general) of
      the Storm Troopers and banned Jews from public places such as restaurants
      and cafes.

    <td width="100%" colspan="2">April 14, 1923 is known as the &quot;Evening of
      Revelation.&quot;&nbsp; On this night, Julius Streicher was at a
      meeting and was told he was a coward, liar, spouse abuser, and adulterer.&nbsp;
      Afterward a long walk in the woods he got the idea to start a newspaper, Der Stuermer.&nbsp; This
      means the &quot;Attacker&quot; in German.&nbsp; It was used to promote
      Anti-Semitism and National Socialism.&nbsp; Nuremburg is the home of Der&nbsp;
      Stuermer.&nbsp; The first issue came out on April 20, 1923 after alot of
      researching.
      <p>Streicher formed the German Socialist party, but the responsibility was
      too hard at the time to handle, and he handed the party over to his hero
      and friend, Adolf Hitler.</p>
      <p>Julius Streicher was a Nazi from 1921-45, even though his work was
      unpopular with some Nazis.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Others were also offended by Streicher's work, but he refused to drop
      the newspaper.&nbsp; After much controversy, in 1923 the newspaper came to a streaking
      halt.&nbsp; Miraculously, Der Stuermer was resurrected in 1924, and it was
      as strong as ever.</p>
      <p>Julius Streicher was determined to educated everyone about the
      Jews.&nbsp; He asked two thousand children, &quot;Do you
      know who the devil is?&quot;&nbsp; The children responded with, &quot;The
      Jew.&nbsp; The Jew.&nbsp; The Jew.&quot;&nbsp; Der Stuermer published
      three anti-Semitism books for children like this.&nbsp; Also,Fritz Frank was hired to
      translate issues of Der Stuermer into Braille.&nbsp; Not all of Der
      Stuermer's information was researched by Julius Streicher, but some of it
      was submitted by the Gestapo and readers/</p>
      <p>In 1924, Julius Streicher became the new Gauleiter of Franconia, but he was suspended in 1932.&nbsp;
      He never came back after the fall.</p>
      <p>Julius Streicher was in charge of the famous Jewish boycott on the first of
      April in 1933.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p> He led the destroying of all the Nurnberg synagogues
      on August 10, 1938.</p>
      <p>Why did Julius Streicher hate the Jews so much?&nbsp; Like many others,
      he blamed the Jews for the fall in Germany's economy after World War
      One.&nbsp; Streicher was convinced that behind every crime there stood a
      Jew.&nbsp; In a picture of the explosion of the Hindenburgh stood a Jewish
      man.&nbsp; Also, after the explosion the cloud was shaped like a Jew's
      face.&nbsp; He was one of the first to notice this, but after he did he
      made sure all of Germany did, too.</p>
      <p>Wilheim Gustloff was an enemy of the Jews. Julius Streicher believed
      that his killer was a Jew after all the haateful things Gustloff said
      about the Jewish race.</p>
      <p>Through Der Stuermer, Julius Streicher brainwashed readers into
      believing that Jews were a disgrace to the human race.&nbsp; He
      continuously told his readers that the Jews were planning on exterminating
      all Gentiles so they could rule over the world.&nbsp; Even if a Jew
      confessed to converting his religious beliefs to Christianity, he was
      still stereotyped as a rat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>There is a medieval belief that Jews killed Christian children.&nbsp;
      These were called &quot;ritual murders.&quot;&nbsp; By informing the
      public of this, people who thought all men are equal,even after Germany's
      fall in economy, were now helping in
      the slaying of thousands of Jews.</p>
      <p>In one of Julius Streicher's issues of Der Stuermer, he compared a
      butcher slaughtering a cow to Jews killing Aryans.&nbsp; The victims of
      Jewish murders' throats were slit, just like that of a pig who is being
      slaughtered.&nbsp; Streicher had special editons on this topic
      alone.&nbsp; It was, what he believed to be, one of the strongest
      statements that would change everyone point of view about the Jews.</p>
      <p>In 1943, Julius Stricher sent a photographer to take photographs at
      death camps.&nbsp; Not to inform the community of these crimes, but to
      brag about it.&nbsp; He published these pictures in Der Stuermer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The owner of Der Stuermer handed over the business to Julius
      Streicher.&nbsp; Streicher wanted to prove that he was an even better
      owner than the last. Every issue after this event&nbsp; Der Stuermer included
      information pertaining to Jewish crimes.&nbsp; Crimes ranged from
      stealing, cheating, and lying to rape and mass murder.</p>
      <p>Julius Streicher took educating Jewish children another step
      farther.&nbsp; He was convinced that today's children are tomorrow's
      Nazis.&nbsp; Der Stuermer published a teaching curriculum on
      anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>Overall, Julius Streicher was Adolf Hitler's mouthpiece.&nbsp; They
      supported each other one hundred percent.</p>
      <p>After realizing that he may be arrested, Julius Streicher tried to hide
      his identity and pretended to be a house painter.&nbsp; He was caught on May 25,
      1946.&nbsp; Julius Streicher was tried and convicted of crimes against
      humanity.&nbsp; The judge sentenced Streicher to death on October 1,
      1946.&nbsp; Before Streicher was supposed to be hung he saluted Hitler by
      yelling, &quot;Heil Hitler!&quot;&nbsp; For no reason, the rope snapped,
      and Streicher fell to the ground.Fifteen days later, Streicher was supposed to be hung again.&nbsp;
      Julius Streicher spat on the hangman's face and yelled," The Bolsheviks
      will hang YOU one day!&quot;&nbsp; Streicher was executed shortly
      thereafter.</p>
