      Adolf Eichmann was born on March 19,
      1906 in Solingen, Germany.&nbsp; After Adolf’s mother died, when he was 10, his
      family moved to Linz, Austria, which was also Hilter’s home town.&nbsp; When
      Eichmann was young he was teased a lot about his dark skin and his
      nickname was “the little Jew” by his classmates, although he was
      Protestant.&nbsp; In 1932 when Eichmann was 26 he was invited to a Nazi party
      meeting by<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Ernst
      Kaltenbunner a family friend.&nbsp; Adolf then signed up.&nbsp; After being laid
      off,
      he sought help from Dr. Ernst.&nbsp; He arranged for Eichmann to be accepted in
      to the S.S. that year he was 28 Eichmann started out as a filing clerk
      cataloging.&nbsp; He was then assigned to the Jewish section.&nbsp; This marked the
      beginning of Eichmann’s interest in&nbsp; Jews.&nbsp; During 1935, the Nuremberg
      Laws were passed and Jewish people were no longer German citizens.&nbsp; During
      this period Eichmann secures his role in the Nazi Party and gained his
      reputation for being an expert in Jewish affairs.&nbsp; Around this time
      Eichmann moves to the Department II 112, The Jewish Department.&nbsp; In 1936
      Eichmann marries Vera Liebel and later has kids.&nbsp; Then he visits Palestine
      to discuss the possibility of a large scale immigration, but they ordered
      him out of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
