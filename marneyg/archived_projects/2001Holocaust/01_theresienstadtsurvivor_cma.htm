      <font face="Cooper Black" size="4">Valerie Borsky was a female Czech Jew
      who survived Theresienstadt.&nbsp; She entered in 1942 at the age of
      29.&nbsp; Her younger sister stayed in Theresienstadt for eight months before she
      was sent &quot;East&quot; to be killed.&nbsp; Her fifty year old mother and fifty-five year old father joined
      Theresienstadt but both died of starvation in one year.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Valie, short for Valerie, worked in the Records Department.&nbsp; Working
      there meant you typed the lists of transports to Poland or Auschwitz-
      Birkenau to be gassed.&nbsp; She worked twelve to Fourteen hours a
      day.&nbsp; Valie and other co-workers typed 10,000 Jews from all over
      Europe on seventy to eighty lists.&nbsp; Valie's name came up to be
      transported four different times.&nbsp; Someone had to fill in her spot
      every time to complete the list.&nbsp;&nbsp; Valie had to type names of friends, family, and her own
      fiancée onto the
      death lists.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Fleas and lice were huge problems along with the contagious diseases and
      Typhus.&nbsp; Hunger was a major problem, too.&nbsp; People had to steal food to survive.&nbsp; Many grew weeds and grass and
      boiled them to eat.&nbsp; The S.S. outlawed it because the horses needed
      to eat.&nbsp; Valie said &quot; If boiled it tastes like
      spinach.&quot;&nbsp; People still stole weeds.&nbsp; Soon potatoes were
      the most valuable food, while staple food was watery soup and stale bread.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Valie lived in a military barrack with other co-working women.&nbsp; She
      slept on the floor with scattered straw and a tattered blanket to keep
      warm.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Valie kept stealing food or trading for food.&nbsp; She was eventually
      caught with three potatoes.&nbsp; The punishment was to be beaten by Czech
      ghetto police armed with whips and clubs.</font>&nbsp; <font face="Cooper Black" size="4">While Valie was being beaten a S.S. officer yelled, &quot;Beat her to
      death, to teach the rest a lesson!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The club hurt her internally.&nbsp; The worst injuries were the broken
      bones in her back, arms, and shoulder.&nbsp; She was hospitalized for
      weeks and the Jewish doctors didn't have the proper medication nor
      equipment to treat her.&nbsp; So as a result she became a
      &quot;hunchback,&quot; with a distorted spine and one leg longer than the
      other.&nbsp; She became four inches shorter and crippled for life.&nbsp;
      She never stood upright again in all her life.&nbsp; Most were treated
      like that by the Nazis.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      When Russia gained control of Theresienstadt, a Typhus epidemic broke
      out.&nbsp; Valie survived while many died because of the epidemic.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      After Theresienstadt was liberated Valie found work.&nbsp; She saved money
      to leave Europe.&nbsp; &quot;I didn't want any part of Europe.&nbsp; I
      hated my own people, and other Europeans as well.&quot;&nbsp; She said.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      She later bought a ticket to Australia.&nbsp; She met a non-Jewish Czech
      named Vladislav Borsky.&nbsp; She and he fell in love and were married on
      the voyage.&nbsp; He was a rich man and when they landed on Australia he
      bought a house and worked in an aluminum factory.&nbsp; Later he opened
      his own business and prospered.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Later they moved to Oakland, California where Vlaislav worked as an
      engineer till retirement.&nbsp; They had a boy who went to medical school
      and is a Ophthalmologist.</font><p><font face="Cooper Black" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      She suffered a heart attack in August in 1995.&nbsp; She died two days
      after.&nbsp;</font></td>
