      Josef Mengele was born March 16, 1911 in Bavaria.&nbsp; He had two younger
      brothers Alois and Karl Jr.&nbsp; His parents ran an implement factory in
      Germany.&nbsp; The three boys didn't receive a lot of love or attention at
      home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Mengele was a very smart
      student.&nbsp; He studied philosophy at Munich and medicine at Frankfurt.
      While studying, Mengele became attracted to racial theories.&nbsp;
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In 1937, Mengele became a member of the Schutzstaffel, or SS.&nbsp; He
      worked as a medical officer in France and the Soviet Union.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      A jury declared Mengele unsuitable for military use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In 1943, Mengele went to Auschwitz voluntarily to conduct medical
      examinations.&nbsp; There he became known as the Angel of Death and the
      Great Selector because he supervised the selections of
      &quot;patients.&quot;&nbsp; Mengele was always clean, wore hand-tailored
      clothing, white gloves, carried a riding crop, and whistled an opera tune
      while selecting.&nbsp; He loved the power he was given.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <table border="0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td width="50%"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            In 1943 Heinrich Himmler appointed Mengele chief doctor at
      Auschwitz.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      </table>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      On a wall in Mengele's office was a collection of human eyeballs.&nbsp;
      They were pinned to the wall with regular pins just like we sometimes pin
      insects to Styrofoam today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survivors said that Mengele was always a very kind fatherly type
      figure.&nbsp; He would bring the children candy and chocolates and ask
      them if they enjoyed their trip.&nbsp; Mengele loved to hear his captives
      tell about how they miss their families, and how mean the guards were, and how
      people would say that they were so scared when a gun was pointed at them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Mengele really hated Jews, but he disliked Roma and Sinta, or Gypsies,
      even more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Eva Mozes Kor, a survivor, said, &quot;No other strip of land on the face
      of this universe has seen so much heartache.&nbsp; The first time I went
      to use the latrine located at the end of the children's barrack, I was
      greeted by the scattered corpses of several children lying on the dirty
      ground.&quot;&nbsp; She said, &quot;Yet being on Mengele's list was better
      than being on no list.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Sora Seiler Vigorito said, &quot;There was fear, a tremendous amount of
      fear.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Several survivors said that Mengele wore this look that said, &quot;I am
      the power.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

      Mengele left Auschwitz in 1945 and became a fugitive.&nbsp; He never
      worked as a Physician again.&nbsp; Mengele went from country to country in
      South America, most likely with the help of his family.&nbsp; Most of the
      time he did not let himself be seen when it was light outside, but while
      hiding in a family's house, they encourage him to go for a swim to clear
      his mind.&nbsp; At first Mengele refused, but he soon gave in.&nbsp; While
      swimming in the ocean, Mengele suffered a severe stroke and became paralyzed.&nbsp;
      He was unable to make it to shore and drowned in 1979.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      Some people still believe that Mengele is living.&nbsp; This is almost
      impossible to be true.</font></p>
