      SS is abbreviations
      for the German word Schutzstaffel means &quot;Defense Corp&quot;.&nbsp;
      The SS operated the Nazi concentration camps during World War 2. With the
      formation of the Schutzstaffel in 1925 there existed two competing and
      separate paramilitary political organization , the SA and SS.&nbsp; Before
      the SS came to power there was another group called the SA that was a
      rival with the SS.&nbsp; After the formation the SS experienced a great
      deal of growth.&nbsp; In 1933, 8 years after the initial formation of the
      SS, it had grown to&nbsp;nearly 50,000 members.&nbsp; The special elite
      body guards hand picked SS men that did his every wish had a new name, and
      were called the SS-Stabswache Berlin.&nbsp; Later the name was changed to
      SS-Sonderkommando Berlin. Two other SS-Sonderkommando units were formed in
      early summer of 1933, SS-Sonderkommando Zossen and SS-Sonderkommando
      Berlin changed once again to <u> Adolf Hitler-Standart</u>.</b></font></td>
