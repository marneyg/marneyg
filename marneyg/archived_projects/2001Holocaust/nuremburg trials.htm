      individuals were indicted in 12 cases,120 of the defendants were given
      prison sentences of various durations.&nbsp; 35 of the defendants were
      acquitted.&nbsp; Among those 185 individuals was Hermann Goering the most
      influential person next to Hitler.&nbsp; After he was tried and sentenced to
      death he managed to commit suicide in his cell.&nbsp; Rudolf Hess (Hitler's
      deputy minister) was sentenced to 40 yrs.&nbsp; During the trials Himmler made
      this speech, &quot; I am a convinced supporter of the idea that what
      matters in the world ultimately is good blood.&nbsp; I have approached my task
      from this angle.&nbsp; It means that actually the only good blood, according to
      our reading of history, is the leading creative element in every state,
      and in particular, the the blood engaged in military activity, and above
      all Nordic blood.&quot;&nbsp; Judges from Great Britain, France, Soviet Union,
      and the United States (also known as the allies) tried the Nazi leaders. Kristallnacht
      was one of the first things that led to the Holocaust which led to many
      new anti-Semitic laws. Julius Striecher&nbsp; was known as the most rapid
      antiseminite in Germany.&nbsp; He was editor of the Chief.&nbsp; He was sentenced to
      death.&nbsp; Hans Frank was appointed minister and Reich commissioner for
      justice.&nbsp; Alford&nbsp; Jodi was chief of operations.&nbsp; He strongly implicated in
      promoting forced labor.&nbsp; He was sentenced to death.&nbsp; Himmler was
      Reich Leader of the S.S.&nbsp; He was the commander and subordinated
      directly to Hitler as head of the Nazi Party.&nbsp; In 1936 he was
      appointed chief of the German Police.&nbsp; The Nazi leaders were tried
      for murder of&nbsp; millions of Jews.&nbsp; In Europe 177 more Nazi
      leaders stood trial in 12 other proceedings. Karl&nbsp; Doenitz&nbsp; was
      made commander&nbsp; of the submarine unit of the navy. He was given 10
      yrs. imprisonment.&nbsp; Erich Reader was a German naval commander and a
      commander in chief of the navy he was Doenitz superior officer. He was
      given life imprisonment. Alfred Rosenberg was a Baltic German and was
      Hitler's chief racial ideologist, and was sentenced to death.&nbsp;
      Wilhelm Frick served as the nazi minister of the interior from 1933 to
      1943. He was sentenced to death by hanging.&nbsp; Justice could not
      tolerate the trial of sadistic concentration camp commanders and guards. </samp></font></b></td>
