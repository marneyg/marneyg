      few Americans had ever heard of Treblinka, a death camp hidden in the
      remote forests of northeastern Poland.&nbsp; It was located 50 miles
      northeast of Warsaw.&nbsp; Most Americans believed that the majority of
      the 6 million Jews died in gas chambers in Dachau, a camp near Munich,
      Germany.&nbsp; They were surely wrong, in the short time Treblinka was a
      camp it claimed a total of 800,000 lives of people from Poland, Austria,
      Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Jugoslavia, Germany, and the
      Soviet Union.&nbsp; Treblinka was located near the Bug River which, during
      the World War Two served as the border for the Nazis and Poland.&nbsp;
      Jews were not the only people killed at Treblinka, some 2,000 gypsies were
      killed there.&nbsp; The camp was run by Imfried Eberl and later Franz
      Stangl.&nbsp; Treblinka got it's name from a tiny village close to the
      camp.&nbsp; The town was closest to Malkinia railroad junction, on which
      the Nazis hauled thousands of Jews in freight cars to Nazi extermination
      camps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font> </td>

      of the three &quot;Action Reinhard&quot; death camps to be built.&nbsp;
      Construction of the camp began in May/June of 1942 and the exterminations
      began in July.&nbsp;</b></font> </td>

      and Sobibor, it served as the destination for over a million people,
      almost all of who were Jews, they were killed almost immediately upon
      arrival.&nbsp; None of them lived to see the next day.&nbsp; The Israeli
      court declared that more that 850,000 Jews were exterminated at Treblinka
      between July 1942 and August 1943, and that is just Jews.&nbsp; In fact,
      shortly after the war one former prisoner and the World Jewish Congress
      said that 3 million people died there.&nbsp; Treblinka is widely regarded
      as the second most important German extermination center.&nbsp; Only
      Auschwitz-Birkenau is said to have claimed more lives.&nbsp;</b></font> </td>

      of Treblinka was covered by tree branches to conceal the activities
      within.&nbsp; In August 1943 a core group of fifty to seventy men planned
      to take weapons from the camp armory to destroy the camp installation and
      allow inmates to flee to the forest.&nbsp; Of the 750 men that tried to
      escape only 70 lived to see liberation.</b></font> </td>

      prisoners were immediately gassed, some were selected to work as laborers
      to keep the killing going and then later on were selected to be
      gassed.&nbsp; Trainloads of up to 5 to 7 thousand people were brought to
      Treblinka.&nbsp; Prisoners were then moved through a selection in which
      women and children were separated from the men.&nbsp; if you were too sick
      to walk then you were taken to an infirmary pit and shot.&nbsp; After
      being separated they took them to get there hair cut.&nbsp; Lastly, you
      were taken to the gas chambers.&nbsp; Treblinka started out with 3 gas
      chambers but quickly built at least 6 more.&nbsp; Prisoners were put in
      what they thought were showers, so they were told, but once they all got
      in there the Nazi officers would turn on the gas and it would come out
      through shower heads.&nbsp; Some would stand there for 30 or 40 minutes
      before they died.&nbsp; They were then searched for valuables.&nbsp; After
      the search the bodies were stacked on old grid railroad tracks to be
      burned.&nbsp; They used to bury them but they ran out of ground. The gas
      chambers were then cleaned and readied for the next group of prisoners.</b></font></td>

      There is no documentary evidence that Treblinka was an extermination
      center.&nbsp; In fact, contemporary records suggest that the camp had a
      very different purpose.&nbsp; Photos suggest that it was actually a
      transit camp.&nbsp; Also the camp's burial area quite obviously appears
      too small to contain the hundreds of thousands of bodies supposedly buried
      there.&nbsp; The generally accepted idea was that hundreds of thousands of
      Jews were killed at Treblinka in gas chambers with poisonous exhaust from
      engines.&nbsp; But the &quot;original&quot; Treblinka extermination story
      was that Jews were steamed in &quot;steam chambers&quot;.</b></font></td>

      As the Allied forces got closer in the fall of 1943, evacuation of the
      camp began.&nbsp; Orders were given to destroy the camp so that no traces
      of it's existence remain.&nbsp; A farm was built over the site of Treblinka
