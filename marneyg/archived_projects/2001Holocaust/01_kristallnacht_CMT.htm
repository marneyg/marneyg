      On this terrible November night all chaos broke loose in Germany.&nbsp;
      This tragic night, known as Kristallnacht, left many Jews homeless and in
      concentration camps.&nbsp; Over 91 Jews were killed, 1,350 synagogues
      burnt, 30,000Jews were placed in concentration camps, and about 7,000
      Jewish shops were destroyed.&nbsp; This night came to be known as

      the Jews that were drug to Poland were left on the boarder all
      night.&nbsp; Many of the survivors fled in the following days.&nbsp; Even
      though they were Polish-born, Poland was already over populated, and
      wouldn't take in everyone that Germany brought over.&nbsp; One of the
      reasons that many of the Jews went over to Germany in the first place was
      because conditions were better, which made life easier.&nbsp; Because
      Poland wouldn't take back a lot of the immigrants, about 12,000 to 17,000
      Jews were left on the boarder between Germany and Poland.&nbsp; The
      Jews who owned businesses were forced to pay for their damages.</b></font></p>

      Poland.&nbsp; The concentration camps are in operation. Forced immigration
      is not an option, and the Nuremburg Laws are already in action.''&nbsp;
      Those are many reasons why the Kristallnacht lead to the Holocaust, but
      what lead to the Kristallnacht?&nbsp; Well, many things but what set it
      off was the assassination of a member of the German Embassy.&nbsp; It was
      a 17 year old Jew named Herschel Gryszpan&nbsp; who killed Ernst vom Rath,
      the Third Secretary.&nbsp; Gryszpan's intentions were to kill the German
      Ambassador to France.&nbsp; He was upset to find that, while he was in
