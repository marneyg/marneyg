            On August 1, 1936 the Olympic games began in Berlin Hitler and top
            Nazis seek to gain legitimacy through favorable public opinion from
            foreign visitors and temporarily refrain from actions against Jews.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Adolf Hitler rides a motorcade through Brandenburg Gate to the
            opening ceremonies of the eleventh Olympiad in Berlin, August
            1,1936.&nbsp; The games had been awarded to Germany before Hitler
            came to power. During the Olympics, a three-week moratorium on
            anti-Jewish measures was put into effect to create a favorable
            impression upon foreign visitors.&nbsp; Inside the newly built
            Olympic Stadium in Berlin, Germans salute Adolf Hitler at the
            opening of the Olympic games.&nbsp; Hitler took a keen interest in
            the games and the early victories of the German athletes.&nbsp;
            However they were over shadowed by the record-breaking performances
            of American runner Jesse Owens.</span>

            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp; In
            Berlin, dictator Adolf Hitler and Nazi followers felt sure that the
            Olympics would be the ideal venue to demonstrate Germany's
            oft-stated racial superiority.&nbsp; He directed that $25 million be
            spent on the finest facilities, the cleanest streets and temporary
            withdraw of all outward signs of the state-run anti-Jewish campaign.&nbsp;
            By this time over 4,000 athletes from 49 countries arrived for the
            games.</span><span style="font-family:Forte"><o:p>

            <p><span style="font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Forte"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            There were doubts in many quarters about the wisdom of attending the
            Berlin Olympics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An
            alternative to be called “Peoples Olympics,” was actually
            scheduled for Barcelona but the Spanish Civil War destroyed that
            plan.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Forte"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#FF0000"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>In the United States a move to boycott the Olympics was led
            by Judge Jeremiah T. Murphy president of the Amateur Union (AAU).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Murphy and his supporters were concerned chiefly about Nazi
            anti-Semitism, since Jewish sports clubs throughout Germany had been
            shut down.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Forte"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#FF0000"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>However, in 1935 the AAU voted by a narrow margin to sanction
            participation and Murphy resigned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>He was replaced by Avery Brunage who went to Germany on an
            inspection tour and that everything looked just fine.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Forte"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#FF0000"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>Despite the preliminary and the growing international
            tensions that were to culminate in World War two, the 1936 Olympics
            attracted more countries (49) and more athletes (4,066) than any
            previous Olympics.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Forte"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#FF0000">But the
            nationalistic and materialistic atmosphere in Berlin alarmed many
            athletes and members of the press.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The ever-present swastika and icon-like portraits of Adolf
            Hitler the material music blared endlessly through loudspeakers were
            disturbing to a lot of people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Nor did it help that many journalists, suspected of anti-Nazi
            sentiments, discovered that their rooms had been searched by secret
            police.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Forte"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4" color="#FF0000"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>In Nazi Germany’s pro Aryan setting, it was ironic that the
            greatest athletic hero was Jesse Owens, the black American runner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Owens won the 100-and200-meter dashes and the long jump and
            also anchored the U.S.A. 400-meter relay team to a gold medal.<o:p>

            </span>Hitler’s ”snub” of Owens is a well-known story, but is
            not accurate. The German leader, who was prominently on display is
            his regale box, personally congratulated the first two Germans and a
            Finn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With darkness
            looming and rain threatening, he left the stadium after all the
            German competitors had been eliminated from the high jump.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            </span>After setting national records in high school Jesse Owens
            attended Ohio State University, where he became an all American.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>On May 25, 1935, at the Big Ten Conference Championships,
            Owens broke three world records and tied a fourth, all in a
            70-minute span.<o:p>
