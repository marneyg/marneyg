      pity or mercy all men women and children of polish decent or
      language&quot;.&nbsp; This is a quote from Adolf Hitler which may give you
      an idea of how gruesome about eleven million people where treated these
      people died.&nbsp; Throughout the World this what has happened at that time
      is called the Holocaust. Many people automatically link it to the slaughter
      of the Jewish.&nbsp; But that is only half true while yes five million
      Jews were put to death during the Holocaust a person who are &quot;The
      Others&quot; as they are commonly referred to.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Lucida Calligraphy"><b>Now before I go on you may want to
      know Hitler planned to make a ultimate race called the &quot;Aryan&quot;
      and that's why he had these people killed.&nbsp; The Aryan race is based
      off the idea of Swiss men strong, blonde hair, blue eyes.&nbsp; Although
      Hitler himself fit his idea of imperfect.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Lucida Calligraphy"><b>Well start off with the
      handicap.&nbsp; When it comes to the handicap it was decided to be a waste
      of time and money to support them.&nbsp; So in January of 1940 the entire Auschwitz
      killing enterprise began with the most helpless of all.&nbsp;
      The institutionalized handicap were slain like cattle.&nbsp; 'This group included
      people who showed signs of mental illness, retardation, physical
      deformity, epilepsy, blindness, deafness, and severe alcoholism'&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font>
      <p><font face="Lucida Calligraphy"><b>Also like the Jewish Gypsies
      were chosen for total annihilation because of their race.&nbsp; These people
      were called 'racially inferior and degenerate there for
      worthless.&quot;&nbsp; One half of a million Gypsies &quot;almost the
      entire European population&quot; were wiped out during the holocaust.</b></font><p><font face="Lucida Calligraphy"><b>Out
      of all the people homosexuals were problem treated the worst.&nbsp; Many
      males from all countries were singled out and persecuted, raped, tortured,
      and executed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy"><b>A good example of
      the hatred for these people, is that Hitler even sent his own men to
      concentration camps if he thought they were homosexual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>On concentration camps they were made to wear pink triangles so
      they could easily be found and be further humiliated.&nbsp;<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy"><b>The people who
      were firmest to their beliefs are Jehovah Witness. From the very beginning
      Hitler was extremely threatened by them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>They refused to worship or believe in any other God besides
      Jehovah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When they were asked
      to pledge loyalty to the Nazi ideology they refused and were intern imprisoned
      as “dangerous traitors” for not pledging loyalty to the
      Third Reich.</b></font><font face="Lucida Calligraphy"><b>&nbsp;<o:p>

      brought into aid France during World War I.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>After the war they had to take up residence in Europe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>A lot of them married white women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Their children were called “Rhineland Bastard” and “Black
      Disgrace”.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      of African descent, they were forced to be sterilized without parents
      knowing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were also sent
      to concentration camps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
