<p align="left">Adolf Eichmann was born on March 6, 1906 in Solingen Germany he has a
sister and five brothers. He grew up in Linz Austria which was Hitler's home
town. And his classmates teased him about his look and called him ''little
Jew.'' He dropped out of high school and he became a traveling sales man. Accepted
into an S.S brigade comprised of Austrians. Soon there after, Eichmann
was invited to join the S.D. the S.S security service, and given the rank the
sergeant. In 1935 he was assigned to the Jewish department of the S.D. and
worked his way to the top.</p>

      <p align="left">He taught himself Hebrew and Yiddish. He studied the Jews,
gathering information about their leaders, synagogues, businesses, culture.
Eichmann married Vera Leibl, a native of Bohemia in 1936 and lived with her in
Prague. He eventually became the father of four children, all
boy's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1932 at age 26 he joined&nbsp; the growing Austrian
Nazi party at the suggestion of his friend Ernst Kalten Brunner. Eichmann then
became a member of the S.S in 1934 served as an S.S corporal at Dachau
concentration
camp.&nbsp;In September 1934 Eichmann found relief from the monotony of that
assignment by getting a job in Heydrich's SD, the powerful SS security service,
Eichmann started out as a filing clerk cataloging information about
freemason's. He was then assigned to the Jewish selection&nbsp;which was busy collecting information on all prominent
      Jews. This marked the beginning of
Eichmann's&nbsp;interest in the Jews.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He studied all aspects
of Jewish meetings and often visited Jewish sections of cities while taking
volumes of notes. He became familiar with the issue of Zionism. He gradually
became the acknowledged 'Jewish specialties', realizing this could have
      positive&nbsp; &nbsp;implications for his career in the S.S. He soon
      attracted the attention of Heydrich and the S.S Reich's fuhrer Himmler who
      appointed Eichmann to head a newly created SD scientific museum of Jewish affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      DR. Losener,'' the ministerial director who was referred to in the
      proceedings, was the expert in change of Jewish affairs in the Reich
      Ministry of the interior. He has died. In his written statement of
      justification, which has appeared only recently he admitted that he knew
      of the activities and&nbsp; that he also informed his superiors accordingly. It must be assumed that every one in the ministry Director
      Losener continued silently in tacit opposition and served his fuhrer as a
      well paid judge in the Reich Administrative court. That is the form that
      the courage of one's convictions takes in the case of a prominate person.
      In the report he wrote in 1950 Losener expresses views about me according
      to which I am supposed to have been a primary figure in the persecution of
      the Jews. But these are simply emotional out bursts, without any
      indication of facts in which these speculations are rooted. The same
      applies to other witnesses. I was asked by the judges whether I wished to
      make an admission of guilt, like the commandant of Auschwitz, Hoss, and
      the Governor General of Poland, Frank. These two had every reason to make
      such an admission of guilt for the orders which he gave, and balked at
      delegating to inferiors Hoss was the one actually carried out the mass of
      killings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
