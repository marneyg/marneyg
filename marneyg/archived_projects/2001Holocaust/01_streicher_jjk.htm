      In 1921 Streicher fell under Adolf Hitler's spell and brought entire party
      into the DAP camp.&nbsp; He decided to become a follower Adolf
      Hitler.&nbsp; Streicher's paper Der Sturmer is is the most infamous
      history.&nbsp; Alough Streicher employed a large staff by&nbsp; the end of
      the 1930's, he always had the final
      say.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      In its early years there was little to suggest the papers future
      notoriety.&nbsp; Streicher began it during his first major battle for
      control of Nuremberg Nazism in 1923.&nbsp; Anti-Streicher forces had held
      an ''Evening if Revelations.''&nbsp; On April 14, 1923 Streicher was
      charged of being a liar, a coward, having unsavory friends, mistreating
      his wife, flirting with other women, accusations that would follow him
      throughout his career.&nbsp; Stretcher's response to begin a

      Later he described how he chose the name Strummer.&nbsp; While wandering
      through the woods on a fine spring day he thought about what to call his
      paper.&nbsp; While resting under a fir tree inspiration struck he jumped
      up and shouted. ''I have it! Since the paper will storm the red fortress
      it shall be called&nbsp; Strummer.''</font></p>

            The first
            issue appeared in early May.&nbsp; Most of it responded to the
            charges his opponents had made, and in responsibility persuasive
            style, but the Jews were not ignored.&nbsp; The issue
            concluded:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

            The next issue carried a vehement attack on Mayor Luppe, an attack
            continued in the third and fourth issue appearing in June, was
            headlined .''Walther Rathenau who he was, what he did, what he
            wanted.&nbsp; ''Rathenau, a leading Jewish politician was&nbsp;
            assassinated&nbsp; the year before.&nbsp; he had been a regular Nazi
            target.&nbsp; The Sturmer had become a privet weapon in Streicher's
            war against Jews.&nbsp; Max Anamm, later director&nbsp; of the
            German press, wrote to Streicher in August 1923 asking him to cease
            publication since the intraparty teud that had spurred.&nbsp;
            Streicher to begin the paper now was settled.</font></p>

            The paper ceased publication entirely for several months after the
            Putsch, but Streicher resurrected it in 1942.&nbsp; By 1925 the
            paper was from outward appearances healthier.&nbsp; The first issue
            sold several thousand copies at most, but by 1927 it was selling 14
            thousand copies weekly, most of them outside Nuremberg.&nbsp; By
            mid-1944, paper shortage had reduced it from its high of sixteen
            pages to four pages. Yet Streicher continued to the end, his final
            issue appeared in February 1945.&nbsp; Announcing the invading
            Allies as tools of international Jewish conspiracy.&nbsp; The issue
            had limited audience.&nbsp; In 1946 Julius Streicher was convicted
            at Nuremberg war crimes trial and was hung</font></p>
