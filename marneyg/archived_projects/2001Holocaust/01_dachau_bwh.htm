      Dachau officially opened
      March 22, 1933. It was liberated in 1945. The people could not release
      prisoners because they may have agitated other people and organized
      groups when released. Dachau was located in upper Bavaria and North-East
      of Munich.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the very first
      days the guards would brutally beat and murder the inmates. Close to the
      end of 1933, there were 4,821 registered prisoners in Dachau. By 1945 there
      were 206,206 registered prisoners. The total death count may never be
      known. Very many died in evacuation marches and death marches. So these
      deaths were never registered.</b></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b><img border="0" src="01_photo05_bwh.jpg" width="480" height="338"></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guards would hang
      anyone who tried to escape, help anyone&nbsp; in escape, seeks outside
      contact by any means, transmits signals, or hide and climbed up on the roof
      of a hut or hid up in the trees. Initially they would bury the dead in ordinary
      graves, but the body count rose so they had to think of other plans for
      the bodies.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Records show
      that&nbsp; 6,223 bodies were exhumed from Leitenberg alone, and 1,124 from
      four other different places. By 1940 body disposal reached a critical
      point. Many of the dead were never registered. The unregistered will probably
      be never known. By 1941 there was well over 6,000 executed people. But
      there names never were registered.</b></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b><img border="0" src="01_photo09_bwh.jpg" width="480" height="242"></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1940 the first
      crematorium was made, by the North-west corner of the camp, and the only
      way of reaching it is a very small footbridge. The ovens were in a wooden
      shed surrounded by a group of trees. It was concealed very well, you can
      tell they chose it very carefully. And it was further isolated by a large
      drainage ditch, the camp wall, a barbed wire fence, and a huge ditch with
      swift flowing water. The crematorium is even hard to see to this day. In
      early 1942, the death rate would outstrip the capacity of the old
      crematorium. They put the manufacturers name on the furnace doors. The
      Nazi's drew up plans for a 4-furnace crematorium, in the early days it
      incorporated five gas chambers. Three months later the SS Headquarters
      in Berlin said to commerce construction for the crematorium the cost would
      be&nbsp; RM 150,000.</b></font><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      new crematorium was completed in 1943. Four of the five gas chambers were
      for fumigation, and the other one was for homicidal purposes. And the name
      would be Baracke X.</b></font><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      'The oven of Dachau and other Nazi camps are not crematoriums.' An older
      crematorium would cremate one body at a time. `It has a heating cycle, an
      incineration cycle, a cooling cycle, and recovery of the ashes.` An oven
      that took bodies after bodies is more often called an incinerator. The
      cremations of cadavers, in the last case,&nbsp; had no cooling period or the
      recovery of ashes between cremations. The new corpses were simply fed into
      the ovens as the old ones were consumed.</b></font><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The cost of the incinerator is quite lower than the cost of a crematorium,
      and the efficiency is considerably higher. Because coal and other
      resources were often in short supply, with the substantial increase with
      the number of cadavers to be incinerated. `The ovens were run continuously;
      many of the bodies were often burned together and the ashes were mixed together.`</b></font><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      They also started making better ovens that could hold 7 or 8 sometimes
      even 9 corpses. They had 4 ovens. The cremation lasted usually about 2
      hours. The ashes would be preserved in urns. The guards would mix the ashes
      together, but later they got lazy and just quit filling the urns and the
      ashes were buried in the grounds of the crematorium.</b></font>

      Dachau was liberated in 1945 by the American troops. There were corpses
      piled enormously in the morgue of the new crematorium, and in front of the
      crematorium. They also found bodies around everywhere on the camp grounds
      and in the huts. Boxcars were filled with corpses by the hundreds. There
      is not a word that can explain such indecency.&nbsp;</b></font><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The homicidal chamber could have been used for gassing the prisoners. It
      was pure murder and you can also tell the Nazis definitely intended to use
      homicidal gas chambers in Dachau. Because hey built and designed such a chamber
      in the camp of Dachau.</b></font><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      On the experimental gassing. Out of the Russian-campaign, Almost all of
      them were Jews. An estimated 900,000 people. `There were
      about 120,000 killed through the Nazi' Euthanasia actions.`</b></font><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      After the depression many companies needed workers without pay so they
      turned to the camps. Dachau slaves were forced to work at all sorts of
      factories; such as Ornier, Zeppelin, BMW, Messerscmitt, and Photo AGFA
      companies.</b></font><p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In the very begging the first inmates were political prisoners, then many
      other prisoners came such as gays and Jews. The savage guards would beat
      them to death. There was practically no escape because Dachau was
      surrounded by an electrical fence. If the prisoners would fall on
      it would mean immediate death. Some people would purposely fall on it to
      kill themselves, because the camps were always that bad especially Dachau.</b></font>
