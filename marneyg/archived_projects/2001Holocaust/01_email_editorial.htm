        <p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Dear 7th graders at Rossville Jr. High<br>
        <br>
        Hi.&nbsp; My name is Mrs. Diana Newman.&nbsp; I work in a middle school
        in<br>
        Connecticut.&nbsp; I am also going to school for my PhD in special<br>
        education.&nbsp; For one of my courses, I have to investigate classroom<br>
        websites.&nbsp; I happened upon your teacher's website tonight.<br>
        <br>
        I would like to comment on your very thorough Holocaust projects.&nbsp;
        As I<br>
        teacher I think that they were done very well.&nbsp; However, I would
        like to<br>
        also tell you how very touched I was reading your websites- you see, my<br>
        husband's parents are survivors of the Holocaust.&nbsp; The information
        that<br>
        you researched and wrote about is very, very true.<br>
        <br>
        My husband's parents were teenagers when they were brought to Auschwitz<br>
        (they did not know each other at the time).&nbsp; My mother-in-law was<br>
        sixteen when she was separated from her mother when they arrived in the<br>
        night at Auschwitz.&nbsp; Her last memory of her mother was seeing her
        taken<br>
        away in a blaze of floodlights. She never saw her again.&nbsp; Her baby<br>
        sister had died in the ghetto of disease. When they lived in the ghetto,<br>
        if a family was lucky they got one skinny chicken, some old rotten<br>
        potatoes and one loaf of bread to last for the WHOLE week. But many<br>
        weeks they didn't even get the chicken.&nbsp; In the camp, my
        mother-in-law<br>
        was examined by Dr. Mengele but fortunately was not &quot;operated&quot;
        on in an<br>
        evil experiment because the war soon ended.&nbsp; Instead, a young Nazi<br>
        soldier took pity on her and snuck her some medicine (she had<br>
        tuberculosis).&nbsp; When the American soldiers liberated the people at<br>
        Auschwitz, my father-in-law was 20 years old and weighed 60 lbs.<br>
        <br>
        It is very moving to hear survivors sing &quot;God Bless America&quot;
        whenever<br>
        they have a meeting of their association-- over fifty years later, they<br>
        still cry and bless American soldiers for saving them.<br>
        <br>
        As a child, my husband did not have ANY grandparents and only one uncle<br>
        (everyone else was exterminated in the camps).<br>
        More and more of the survivors of the horror of the Holocaust are dying<br>
        now of old age.&nbsp; Soon none of them will be alive.&nbsp; Their
        biggest fear of<br>
        dying is that no one will remember what happened after they are all<br>
        gone. They are afraid that no one will remember all those who died&nbsp;
        and<br>
        that these atrocities could happen again to anyone.<br>
        <br>
        I am so pleased to have been able to see your work on the internet.&nbsp;
        I<br>
        think that projects such as yours will help future generations to work<br>
        for peace. Thank you for sharing your work.<br>
        <br>
        Mrs. Diana Newman<br>
