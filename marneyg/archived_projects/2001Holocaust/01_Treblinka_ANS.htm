    As soon as the prisoners got there, those to sick to walk were taken to a
    nearby pit and shot.&nbsp; Then the healthy ones heard a speech by an SS

    were to be glanced at and then sent either to the left or the right.&nbsp;

    up to just one man.&nbsp; Mostly mothers, older women, older men, young
    children, and the people that were sick were sent to the left.&nbsp; Young
    men and women were usually sent to the right.&nbsp; After the
    &quot;selection&quot; the soon to be victims would then have to send
    postcards to encourage their relatives to settle east.&nbsp; The victims

    The chambers were 656 by 820 feet and completely was fenced in and separated
    from the rest of the camp.&nbsp; The brick building had three gas chambers
    in it and looked like showers from the outside and in.&nbsp; Pipes were
    attached to the ceiling&nbsp; that ended in what looked like shower
    heads.&nbsp; The chambers were to create the impression of a shower.&nbsp;
    After the victims had all their hair shaved off they were taken in.&nbsp;
    Once inside the order from a German officer to a Ukrainian officer was
    &quot;Ivan, water&quot; which then the gas would slowly expand through the
    building killing as it went.&nbsp; The gassing didn't always happen
    fast.&nbsp; Since the room was tightly packed it would sometimes take up to
    30 to 40 minutes before the victims actually died.&nbsp; Then the corpses
    were removed from the building through a different door and searched for
    valuables.&nbsp; After that they were dragged to mass graves and then the
    orders were to dispose of them in a efficient way.&nbsp; Starting in the
    Fall of 1942 this meant dragging the bodies to a grid and burning
    them.&nbsp; The chambers were then cleaned and made ready for the next group
    of prisoners.&nbsp; SS sergeant Franz Suchomel describes it:</font>

      Treblinka 1 was a prison where Polish and other prisoners did labor work 
      in large sand and gravel quarries. The accused prisoners then built 
      Treblinka 2, which was an extermination, camp. The work began in the late 
      May and ended on July 22, 1942. They combined camps and just called it
      Treblinka. When they built Treblinka 1the prisoners built 2 fences. The 
      outside was a barbed wire fence and the inside was a fence with tree 
      branches covering it so you couldn't see the activities going on inside. 
      Treblinka was built in a rectangle shape 1,312 feet wide by 1,968 feet 
      long. It had guard towers at each corner. The pits were 5 acres long. When 
      it was built there were 3 chambers, but in September 3 larger chambers 
      were built, with a total of 6 all together.</FONT> </P>

Israel’s Supreme Court will decide if John Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian-born 
American factory worker, really is "Ivan the Terrible" the "butcher" of
Treblinka, who ran the gas chambers. Some witnesses’ state that he was there, 
while others said that he wasn’t, and even one man stated that he even thought 
that he had killed him. But since scientists found a new illness called the 
Holocaust Survivor Syndrome, the witnesses can’t be called evidence. The only 
hard evidence is that his I.D. card shows that he’s from Trawniki training camp, 
which puts him in Sobibor, a different concentration camp.</FONT></P>
