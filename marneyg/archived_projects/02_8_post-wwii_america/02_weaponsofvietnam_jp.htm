      attack situations. It was belt fed, gas powered
      and fired about 550 rounds a minute. Each belt of ammunition could hold
      almost any number of bullets. It could be fitted with a bipod or tripod.
      While it was a solid machinegun the weight of the ammunition limited what

      farther along in this report.) It weighed 6.6 lbs, was 36.6 inches long
      and had a pistol grip. It could fire rifle grenades and .45 caliber
      bullets. It was also a selective-fire gun, which means the user could
      chose between a fully automatic weapon or a semiautomatic weapon. The
      definition of semiautomatic is when bullets pop out as fast as you pull
      the trigger. It had initial jamming problems, but those were cleared up
      later,&nbsp; soldiers with this problem simply learned from experience to fill the clip to
      27 or 28&nbsp; rounds instead of fully filling the clip.</font></td>

      The T21 was an anti tank weapon that fired an HE or high explosive round
      and saw heavy usage in 'Nam. Its Rate Of Fire or ROF, was 5 rounds per minute
      or 5 rpm. Its penetration power on a moving object was about 230mm of penetration,
      and its powers of penetration on a still target was 650mm. Its was mainly
      transported by truck and so was pretty much limited to roads.&nbsp;</font></td>

      tanks that passed near. Its caliber was 82mm and it weighed about 72,2 kg.
      it fired a HEAT, HE, or a high explosive round (they are all the same thing).
      It was operated by a crew of 4 and was usually towed behind a truck it usually

      The B11 was yet another anti-tank gun that saw heavy use in Vietnam. It
      fired a He or high explosive round and was breech-loaded like a shotgun.
      It had the GODLY range of 6650 meters. Its Rate Of Fire (ROF) was 5 rounds
      per minute. Its penetration over all was about 380mm of armor. It had
      motor car wheels, but these proved so awkward to have on that the where
      only used for transportation and never for firing off of. It weighed about
      305 kg and had the powerful 107mm caliber.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

      !!!!The Howitzer!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This weapon was about
      the only useful artillery weapon we had&nbsp; and&nbsp; as such, it was
      often used to assail enemy positions. Its caliber was 105mmm giving it a hefty
      package to deliver, combined with an ROF of 5 rounds a minute it provided
      steady and reliable fire. It was often called to launch many different ammunition
      types but mainly fired a HEAT round. It could be towed by truck but was
      light enough to be deployed by a helicopter, so this thing could most any
      where.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

      And last but Not least the M-79 grenade launcher (above) . While it wasn't
      an anti tank weapon this still packed a hefty punch, by firing a 40mm
      grenade between the min range for a mortar and the max range for a thrown
      grenade this thing had a range of up to 300m and the unbelievable kill radius
      of 5m. Now lets do the math a 40mm grenade which is TINY,
      explodes and that kills most Anything in 15 feet. This powerful gun was light weight,
      only weighed 1 1/2 Lbs. The BOOM and the weight made this weapon favored. </td>
