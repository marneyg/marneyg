              <hr>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ff00ff" size="3">If
              a young man had long hair and dressed rebelliously last summer,
              chances were he referred to himself simply as a &quot;long
              hair.&quot; Chances were even greater that he was a
              &quot;beatnik&quot; to his elders. This summer, just about
              everyone is in agreement that such a youth is a
              &quot;hippie.&quot;<br>
              </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ff00ff" size="3">There
              is, of course, the exception of media such as<i><b> U.S. News
              &amp; World Report</b></i>, which in a July 17 story told the
              reader that the term &quot;beatnik&quot; was out-dated but
              proceeded to call today's longhaired liberals by this name
              throughout the article. Anyways, that magazine did say something
              about being &quot;always considered a few years behind the
              times.&quot;<br>
              </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ff00ff" size="3">All
              this reflects two reasons why there exists such a wide
              communication gap between the established social community and the
              so-called &quot;hippie&quot; tribes.<br>
              </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ff00ff" size="3">First
              off, the tags are becoming too overpowering in their form of
              general identification. If a long-haired high school sophomore
              breaks a window on the Sunset Strip, word of hippie vandalism
              spreads and a long-haired artist, who is older and takes his
              beliefs and protest more seriously, suffers.<br>
              </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ff00ff" size="3">Secondly,
              there is the gap of being &quot;a few years behind the
              times.&quot; Too many adults are taking a critical look at today's
              youth with over-played remarks of &quot;When I way young,
              blabbablab.&quot; What they fail to realize is that the times of
              their youth no longer exist. Pressures, compounded by an avalanche
              of ideas and knowledge, have greatly intensified. The whole world
              has become a throbbing hotbed of revolutions; politically,
              socially, industrially, scientifically and spiritually.<br>
              </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ff00ff" size="3">This
              gap of understanding is bouncing American society from one
              blackeye to another; Berkley, the Sunset Strip, Century Plaza and
              tomorrow.<br>
              </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ff00ff" size="3">In
              the meantime, the long hair, who stars in this modern American
              Revolution, continues to sprinkle himeslf across the nation. He is
              photographed, written about, placed before live TV audiences ...he
              is both fancied and stoned (no pun intended), but he is seldom
              really listened to.<br>
              </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ff00ff" size="3">What
              makes a youth leave a well-to-do family, college, jobs and the
              established norm of life altogether? And what becomes of such a
              person?<br>
              </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ff00ff" size="3">Realistically,
              the answers and possibilities are as varied as the individuals
              involved. But a good deal of insight does come when one</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ff00ff" size="3">focuses
              in on the following persons.</font></p>

              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ff00ff" size="3">In
              early August, 1966, 12 long-haired youths left Chicago for
              California. Behind them, they left 18 others who would follow once
              additional transportation had been obtained. Of the 12 who led the
              migration west, three of them came onto the dirt lawn of <b>Pandora's
              Box</b> one night in mid-month.<br>
              </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ff00ff" size="3"><b>Pandora's
              Box</b>, which islanded at Sunset and Crescent Heights Boulevards,
              was then smoldering over a long list of complaints charging police
              with unjust treatment of long-haired youths. In a matter of
              months, on the night of Nov. 12, 1966, the Sunset Strip
              demonstrations were to begin here. The nightclub would soon be
              ordered closed and. months later, on Aug. 3 it would be demolished
              to make way for a $700,000 traffic realignment.<br>

              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ff00ff" size="3">The
              three long hairs who came to this 20th century Alamo over a year
              ago were Darryl Jacobs, 22, Jeff Byron, 20, and Ion Bishop, also
              20. Dressed rather crudely, they had some money in their pockets.
              But it would have been of no significance had they been broke.
              Money was one thing they had little need for.<br>
