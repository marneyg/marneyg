      The United States quickly started working on
      our own satellite.&nbsp; Then, on January 31, 1958, we launched Explorer
      1.&nbsp; It's job was to document the existence of radiation zones around
      the Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not too much later, we launched Echo 1 on August 12,
      1960.&nbsp; Based on Echo 1 successes, Echo 2 was launched January 25,

      failure.&nbsp; When the three astronauts onboard were over 320,000 kilometers from
      Earth NASA heard, &quot;Ok, Houston, we've had a problem here,&quot; come
      over the radio.&nbsp; An oxygen tank blew up and severely damaged the
      service module and left the command module without power or
      air.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      three astronauts on board had to move into another part of the spacecraft
