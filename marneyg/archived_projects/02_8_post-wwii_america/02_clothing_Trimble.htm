    <td width="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      the sixties they had many of the same clothes we have today.&nbsp; For
      example pedal pushers were popular pants that we now call capris.&nbsp;
      they are just between pants and shorts.&nbsp; Hip huggers and bell bottoms
      which we now call flairs were stylish kinds of jeans.&nbsp; Women liked
      dresses especially mini ones.&nbsp; For hip looking feet fishnet socks and
      go go boots were a popular choice.&nbsp; PF Flyers were shoes that were
      said to make you run faster and jump higher.&nbsp; Some jeans had funky
      lace or designs on them.&nbsp; Underwear that had the day of the week on
      them was a hit that no one saw.&nbsp; Girls liked fake eyelashes along
      with white lipstick.&nbsp; Now for hair, classy beehives or
      &quot;twiggy&quot; haircuts were usually the &quot;in thing&quot;.&nbsp; </td>
