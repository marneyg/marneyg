      not very good. During 1973 and 1974 Nixon made three speeches on the
      scandal.&nbsp; the first speech was on the departure of Dean, Haldeman,
      and Ehrlichman on April 30,1973. On August 15, 1973 a more defiant
      speech was delivered. But the most difficult speech on April 29, 1974 was
      when he talked about the White House tapes.&nbsp;</td>

      started in February of 1973. That's when the Senate Committee started. The
      initial investigation of Watergate was influenced mostly by the
      media.&nbsp; There was two reporters from &quot;The Washington Post,&quot;
      their names where Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.&nbsp; The public
      hearings of the Committee where focused on the evidence of John
      Dean.&nbsp; He was Nixon's former White House Counsel man.&nbsp; Dean
      brought up secrets of the White House tapes, which sparked a major
      political battle between Nixon and Congress. In 1974 the House authorized
      the Judiciary Committee to consider impeaching Nixon, the vote went
      8-0.&nbsp; Nixon had other problem too, the IRS found out that he made a
      deduction of his income taxes, which had been after they passed the tax
      laws.&nbsp; After that the IRS charged him with back taxes and
      interest.&nbsp; The burglars of Watergate and two other plotters where all
      charged with burglary, conspiracy, and wire tapping.&nbsp; </td>

      1974 Nixon spent his final days in the White House.&nbsp; Nixon had three
      different things he could do. One was the Articles of Impeachment. The Supreme
      Court came with its final blow to order Nixon to release the tapes.&nbsp;
      This was know as the &quot;Smoking Gun.&quot;&nbsp; People around the
      country thought that Nixon should resign, even the former&nbsp;
      president.&nbsp; Then on August 8, 1974 Nixon delivered his resignation
      speech in front of millions of people.&nbsp; Harry S. Truman thought of
      Nixon as, &quot;a no good lying bastard, he can lie out both sides of his
      mouth at the same time, and if he ever was caught telling the truth he'd
      lie just to keep his hand in.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
