      On November 22, 1966 at 12:30 shots rang out as President John F. Kennedy,
      fatally shot, and his wife Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy were on a speech
      making tour in Dallas, Texas. The President was rushed to Parkland
      Memorial Hospital where he was announced dead half an hour later at 1:00
      P.M. central standard time. The country was mourning his death Because he
      was such a good President. To ease the mourning Vice President made the
      Warren Commission to investigate the murder. Later the police arrested 24
      year old Lee Harvey Oswald.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      Jacqueline Kennedy was waving to her left when she heard the shots. That
      was when she looked over and saw the President holding his throat. Then
      she heard another shot and saw the back of his head being blown off. 2
      hours later Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as President.
      People panicked all over the country thinking it was communism. Some
      people even started riots and even shut down their business. Even schools
      shut down for a few days to cool down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      As the nation was just recovering they saw Jack Ruby kill Lee Harvey
      Oswald on national television. Maybe he was killed for some kind of cover.
      Whatever the case may be&nbsp; the only way to figure out if it was really
      Oswald was to interrogate him and the police never had time to. </font></td>

      The Warren Commission came up with the single bullet theory. It said that
      there was only one gunmen, &quot;OSWALD&quot;. It was said to go one
      bullet hit the ground. One grazing the Presidents neck, and entering
      Conally through his back out his chest into his hand and into his thigh.
      The third bullet shattering the back of the Presidents skull. That's what
      the Warren Commission even though 77% of Americans DO NOT believe
      it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      The gun that was found was the assassins Oswald. It was a 6.5MM Manhliche
      Carcano Rifle and there was 3 shells used. They found the gun behind some
      boxes on the sixth floor of a school house. Lee Harvey Oswald had to of
      planned it months in advance. Because he had to plan where to shoot from,
      where the quickest getaway was, and where to put his car to getaway
      faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      Now here is a little about Oswald. He was born October 18, 1939. He was
      killed by Jack Ruby on November 24, 1963. When he was a child he lived in
      21 different places in 17 years. When he was thirteen years old he took a physiological
      exam. The exam said he aggressive tendencies, but no neurological
      impairment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      As an adult he did varies things that proved him aggressive like he
      attempted suicide by cutting his wrists. He also moved a lot like when he
      was a child. He moved over to the Soviet Union and lived there a while. He
      joined in the Marines. He beat up his girlfriend. When he was being
      arrested,&nbsp; after he murdered Kennedy, he shot and officer Tippit.
      Still people do not know if he was the shooter who killed JFK, or if he
      helped kill him, or if he just had nothing to do with
      it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      Another possibility to Kennedy's assassination is Communism. The CIA
      thought Kennedy was working for the Cubans, because the CIA believed he
      dealt with the Cubans to lightly when the Soviet Union moved their missiles
      over there. That caused the CIA not to like. And they would probably have
      done anything to stop him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      Now a new FBI document that was released recently shows that George Bush
      was behind the assassination. It shows that Bush was working with now
      famous CIA agent Felix Rodriguez. Bush was in Texas the day Kennedy was
      assassinated but he would not say where. Bush also says he never worked
      with the CIA until the Warren Commission Director appointed him in 1976.
      But now documents now show much earlier. That's just another possibility
      out of the hundreds that are out there. </font></td>

      Some people even say Vice president Lyndon B. Johnson had a lot to do with
      it. Because who would get the most out of it. He sworn in as president. He
      made the Warren Commission as I said earlier, but whatever evidence they
      found they had to report it to him. As if to say he was running it all and
      he could have released almost any thing out to the public he wanted.&nbsp;</font></td>

      that is enough about the possibilities of the assassination now here is
      some facts about Kennedy himself. He had numerous experiences in many
      other jobs like: He was a lawyer, an author a United States Senator, and
      the President of the United States. He married Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy
      in 1951, they had three kids named Patrick who died after his birth, John
      F. Kennedy Jr., and Caroline. His parents names were Joseph and Rose
      Kennedy. The autopsy of John doesn't tell very much because from looking
      at it, it has many possibilities of what could of happened. And why were
      so many documents kept secret.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      Kennedy, when he was running for president, beat Richard Nixon with the
      closest margin in history. He died at 1:00 P.M. Central Standard time. He
      fought in WWII. He was a commander of a P.T. boat in the Solomon Islands.
      But it got rammed and he was stranded for several days. When they were
      found he go back to the war because of his back problems. He started his
      political career early. He ran for mayor and won, then he ran for Senate
      and won, and then he ran for president and won that. He won many votes
      from Americans in all of those elections. But someone cut this bright
      presidents life short. WHO DID IT? The world may never know.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>
