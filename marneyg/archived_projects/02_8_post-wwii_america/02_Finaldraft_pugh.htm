      September 5, 1972 something unforgettable happened at one of the Olympic
      village houses on 31st Connolly street.&nbsp; Nothing felt, looked, or
      seemed different, but there were a group of five terrorists dressed in
      sweats with bags holding weapons.&nbsp; They jumped the fence.&nbsp;
      Nothing unusual because people saw athletes jump the fence all the time
      going or coming to practice.&nbsp; It was to be found out that the
      terrorists were from a group called <i> BLACK&nbsp; SEPTEMBER</i></font><i><font size="3">.</font></i>
