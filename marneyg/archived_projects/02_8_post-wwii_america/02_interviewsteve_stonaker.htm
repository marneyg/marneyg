      <p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an interview done by Bob
      Colacello talking to Steve, one of the owners of Studio 54.&nbsp; Other
      people included in this interview is Andy Warhol, and Bianca Jagger,
      Truman Capeto.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: I'm always amazed when that silver man in the moon
      drops from the sky, and then the coke spoon goes up his nose . . .</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: Next, we're doing a popper with a cerebrum, a
      cerebellum, and all the parts of the brain. And the popper is going to
      shoot up the nose, which will light up the brain, and then the whole thing
      is going to explode. Every night it's going to explode - fight on the
      dance floor.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: Did you ever dream you'd meet all these people who
      come to your discos?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: No, and I love it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: Bianca, Mick, Baryshnikov, Rod Stewart . . .</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: And we get along; I like them. I always got my
      enjoyment out of people, not out of things. If I didn't make one red cent,
      I would do Studio 54.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: When are memberships starting?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: We're giving out the cards, but it's all done by
      sight. That's why I stay by the door. People say, &quot;Why do you subject
      yourself to staying by the door?&quot; But if I leave the door alone, the
      crowd doesn't end up the way I want it. There's a certain type of person
      we don't pass. People come to me and say, &quot;I'm a millionaire from
      Tucson, Arizona,&quot; but I don't care what they are if they're not fun,
      if they're going to be bumps on a log and sit around.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: Girls tell me you won't let single girls in.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: Well, we don't want it to be a pickup place. If
      we become an East Side singles place then it stops being fun because
      everybody concentrates on picking people up instead of having fun.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: Is it a gay bar, basically?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: It's bisexual. Very bisexual. Very, very, very
      bisexual. And that's how we choose the crowd, too. In other words, we want
      everybody to be fun and good-looking.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: How do you choose the waiters?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: They're as important as the lights, the sound,
      and everything else. It's a total environment place and they have to be
      fun and they dance around. I encourage them to be friendly and have a good
      time and just be very, very, very loose. The waiters, bartenders,
      everybody. People go there to have a good time, it's their evening out,
      they don't go there to have any problems. Once they get through the door
      they can do anything they want. Some people say it's hard to get through
      the door but that's very important, to keep the place that way. You know
      the other night Rod [Stewart] was really worried about how people would
      react to him and he just loosened right up. He was dancing, running around
      the dance floor. I don't know if you saw him Wednesday night with Elton
      [John]?</font></p>

      time.</font>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: Oh, they're wonderful. Some people knock them,
      but they're wonderful people. People knock Sinatra. He filmed there last
      week. He couldn't have been nicer.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: People always knock celebrities.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: I don't know why. Like Bianca, she's a sweet
      heart, you know. She never asks for anything. She just always wants to
      come in and have fun and not be bothered by photographers and the press.
      She's warm. After her birthday party we went back to her house and she and
      Halston made breakfast. It was one of the most fabulous moments of my
      life.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">By the time the following interview was published, in
      June 1978, Studio had become as important a New York destination as the
      Empire State Building, and Rubell and his partner, Ian Schrager, were
      experiencing more and more of the problems associated with success.
      Colacello, Rubell, and Andy Warhol lunched at the Upper East Side
      restaurant Quo Vadis.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: Could we have you photographed on Monday? The photo
      studio is downtown near us.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: That's no problem. I bought a limousine. It's the
      best. I hated buying it. I probably haven't spent a nickel from the
      Studio. I still live off my restaurants.</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">BOB: Mr. Douglas, this is Steve Rubell, the owner of
      Studio 54.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: I heard you were there last night.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">KIRK: I love your place.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: We had a party earlier and I went home to sleep
      for two hours. I heard you were there and I hurried to get there but you'd
      left. I got there at one o'clock.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">KIRK: I enjoyed it very much. We'll be back there again.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: How long are you in New York?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">KIRK: I have to go to a Friars function for Walter
      Cronkite, David Brinkley, and Howard K. Smith. I leave this weekend.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: If you can, try to make it in. I'd love to have
      you.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">KIRK: I'll come and see you again. Take care of
      yourself.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">[KIRK leaves.]</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: How do you decide who gets in? Remember, Andy, you
      once told me Steve has his rules.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">ANDY: Yes. But he always changes them.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: You don't let people in who wear their collars
      outside their jacket.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: Right. I hate that. And I hate those plaid
      polyester shirts or those double-knit suits. It looks like Saturday Night
      Fever. We don't want that look.</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">BOB: Hollywood left.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BIANCA: I'm so glad. No competition. I finally got my
      eight hours.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: I'm going to sleep this afternoon. I've got to do
      it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">ANDY: Steve, maybe you could name every person that's
      ever come into the club - or everyone that went to Bianca's party.</font></p>

      Simon, Carol Lynley, Candice Bergen, Art Garfunkel, Cardin, Ryan O'Neal .

      Interview's cover, his and Schrager's problems had mounted: They were
      under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service. That didn't stop
      Rubell from acting festively when he lunched again with Warhol and
      Colacello at Quo Vadis. Soon after the conversation began, they were

      ANDY: I kept missing you last night, Bianca.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BIANCA: I know. I kept calling you everywhere. You told
      me you were going to Elaine's, so I went to Elaine's.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">ANDY: I went to Trader Vic's for a drink. Then I went to
      the Studio. Your message on the phone was, &quot;Let's go to Studio 54 at
      eleven-thirty.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BIANCA: The perfect hour is between eleven-thirty and
      two. I think two is the limit and one should go to bed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">[BIANCA leaves.]</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: Now we're starting on [our patty for] Valentine's
      Day. It's like doing a production. We're probably doing a St. Valentine's
      Day Massacre.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">TRUMAN: You know that thing in the back where those
      people get up and dance? We could all line up and have somebody bring a
      machine gun and mow us down.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">ANDY: A real machine gun?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: The other day, when I got that pie in the face, I
      went into shock for a second.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: You're not somebody until that guy has thrown a pie
      in your face.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: It was a real cheap pie.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">ANDY: The one he threw at me was cherry. With fake
      whipped cream.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">TRUMAN: What did you expect, Les Delices Cote Basque?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: Steve, where did you go to high school?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: Wingate. That's in Brooklyn. I was playing a lot
      of tennis at the time. My father always said the biggest problem I had on
      the tennis courts was that I'd never concentrate on the ball. I was always
      looking around to see what was going on around me.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">TRUMAN: You still do that.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: Oh, yeah.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">TRUMAN: I notice it quite often at the Studio. When
      you're talking to somebody you're already talking to somebody else. Of
      course, that's natural by the very nature of the role and the job you have
      to do there. It's so difficult to live right in the moment, isn't it?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: It's very difficult, but I like it. I have to
      know what's going on everywhere in the room - at least for two-thirds of
      the night. I'm always watching the door. It's got to be like people coming
      into your living room. If you're inviting ten people into your living
      room, there are certain people you wouldn't want to have because they all
      wouldn't mix. I think the best thing to do is keep it so that one group
      doesn't override the whole place.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">TRUMAN: Balancing the canvas.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: Or making a salad. It's the same thing. It's like
      casting a play. If it gets too straight then there's not enough energy in
      the room. If it gets too gay then there's no glamour. It's no fun. There
      are no pretty girls.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">ANDY: Nobody ever bothers you [at Studio].</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="4">STEVE: There are certain celebrities who are very open
      to people. There are others that just walk by and aren't. If you have a
      Dolly Parton, she opens herself up to everybody. It's almost dangerous.
      Diana Ross is very open to the people. She likes to dance. She also likes
      to sit down and be alone. I think Lillian Carter was the funniest [recent
      visitor]. She said, &quot;Why are all these boys dancing together? There
      are all these pretty girls around.&quot;&nbsp;

    <td width="100%"><font size="4">TRUMAN: Lillian Carter had always thought
      that Anita Bryant was such a sweet girl, that she sang so well. Now that
      she's read all those things Anita Bryant said about gay people, she just
      hates her.</font>
      <p><font size="4">Sometimes, when I'm sitting up in that booth at 54, I
      think about all the dead people who would have loved 54. It's a shame
      they're not around - people like Ronald Firbank or Toulouse-Lautrec or
      Baudelaire or Oscar Wilde or Carl Van Vechten. Cole Porter would have
      loved it.</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">STEVE: I didn't think Bob Hope would like it, but he
      did. He was dancing.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">ANDY: He's probably a lot of fun.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">TRUMAN: I knew Bob Hope when I had a house in Palm
      Springs. I knew his wife. She's quite nice.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: Johnny Carson took his shirt off. He's a good
      sport. The most difficult people are probably the rock people.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">TRUMAN: They don't like disco.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: They're all doing it. Mick Jagger has a disco
      song - &quot;Miss You.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">TRUMAN: That's rather good.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: Who thought of the name Studio 54?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: That was the name of the theater. It was called
      Studio 52. It made no sense to be called Studio 52 when it was on 54th
      Street. That meant everybody would go to 52nd Street. Although people
      don't even think like that from out of town. They never know where it is.
      They don't know that 54 means 54th Street. I was coming here in a taxi.
      The driver said, &quot;I tell people not to go there because I know
      they're not going to get in. I know which ones will get in.&quot; This is
      a cabdriver. He knows which ones won't get in. He said, &quot;You won't
      get in and I know who gets in.&quot; He said, &quot;I try to tell them
      they just aren't dressed right.&quot; He was dead serious. He was like a
      real truck-driver cabdriver. He said, &quot;I always tell them they won't
      get in. I just wait and I pick them right back up in the car.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">ANDY: Do you have a hard time getting in, Truman?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">TRUMAN: Occasionally, they can't see me. I'm too short.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: Was John Kennedy, Jr., there on New Year's Eve?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">ANDY: No. They were away.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: I hate missing it when something goes on in the
      place.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: The most exciting person I ever met there was a
      deaf-mute hillbilly at the Dolly Parton party.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: People come there in wheelchairs. There was a guy
      there Tuesday night in a wheelchair. I said, &quot;Why are you here?&quot;
      He said, &quot;Why shouldn't I be here?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">TRUMAN: That's a good answer.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">BOB: I've never seen you dance at 54, Steve.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: I do - late. You see the pictures. There are all
      these places where I've found out people have been hiding and things have
      been going on that I'm trying to end. I don't want to lose control.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">ANDY: That one room up near the stairway. People
      disappear in there.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: Do you know how Dolly Parton left the Studio the
      night of the raid? She said, &quot;Oh, I don't want to leave with the
      regulars.&quot; On top of the balcony there's a staircase. It's like a
      ladder thing. She went down five stories. That's how she left. She said,
      &quot;I came in an exciting way. I want to leave in an exciting way.&quot;</font></td>

      1980 issue of Interview, Rubell and Schrager were on the way to jail,

      <p><font size="4">BOB: Steve, what are you going to do the night before
      you go [to jail]?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">STEVE: The night before I go I'm going to go to the
      Studio. I'm looking forward to hearing a lot, so you'd better give me a
      lot of good information. I've never not grown from a period in my life, no
      matter how bad it seemed when it was beginning. I think I've been sort of
      on a whirlwind and I think it might be good to stop now even though it's
      forced and I wish it wasn't forced. I'm going away with a very good sense.
      At the [going-away] party the other night, the people were so nice. Who
      was there? It was De Niro, Pacino, Diana Ross, Lauren Hutton, Richard Gere,
      Barry Diller, Debbie Harry. They've been so supportive. I'm sure there are
      people who are happy and are saying we deserve what we got. [But most]
      people have been so fiercely loyal. Some of the media like to say that
      these people desert people, but they don't. I'm not looking forward to
      going away, but I do know that we have the best people in the city who on
      their own could do anything. The day after the sentence everyone who works
      there came around and they all looked so bad. I was so busy trying to
      console them that I'd forgotten that I'd just been sentenced.</font></p>
