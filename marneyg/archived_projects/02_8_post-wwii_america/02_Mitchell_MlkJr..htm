      HAVE A DREAM<br>
      By Dr. Martin L. King Jr.<br>
      [Delivered on the steps at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. on
      August 28, 1963]</center><br>
      </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>I am
      happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the
      greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Five
      score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand
      today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as
      a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves, who had been
      seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak
      to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the
      Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is
      still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of
      discrimination.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>One
      hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the
      midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the
      Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds
      himself an exile in his own land. So we've come here today to dramatize a
      shameful condition.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>In a
      sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the
      architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution
      and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note
      to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all
      men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the
      inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>It is
      obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar
      as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred
      obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which
      has come back marked &quot;insufficient funds.&quot;</b></font>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>But we
      refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to
      believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of
      opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check, a check
      that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of
      justice.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>We have
      also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of
      Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the
      tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the
      promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate
      valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the
      time to lift our nation from the quicksand's of racial injustice to the
      solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for
      all of God's children.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>It would
      be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This
      sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until
      there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen
      sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro
      needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude
      awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>There
      will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted
      his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake
      the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>But there
      is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold
      which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our
      rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to
      satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and
      hatred. We must ever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and
      discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into
      physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of
      meeting physical force with soul force.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>The
      marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not
      lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers,
      as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their
      destiny is tied up with our destiny. They have come to realize that their
      freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>And as we
      walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot
      turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights,
      &quot;When will you be satisfied?&quot; We can never be satisfied as long
      as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.
      We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of
      travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels
      of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi
      cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to
      vote. No, no, we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until
      justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>I am not
      unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and
      tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of
      you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by
      the storms of persecutions and staggered by the winds of police brutality.
      You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with
      the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi,
      go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back
      to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities,
      knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not
      wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you today, my friends, so even
      though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow. I still have a
      dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.</b></font>
      <p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><b>I have a

      created equal.</b></font>

      girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as

      revealed and all flesh shall see it together.</b></font>

      of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling
      discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this
      faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle
      together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together,
      knowing that we will be free one day. This will be the day, this will be
