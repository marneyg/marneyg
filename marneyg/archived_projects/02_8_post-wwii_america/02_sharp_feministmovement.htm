      the period in between 1972 and 1982 when women felt like they deserved
      more self-respect than they were getting.&nbsp; Thirty-five percent of women
      were employed by 1960.&nbsp; Some felt the reason why the number was so
      low was because they were discriminated against.&nbsp; Even boys and girls
      as young as in elementary school were treated differently.&nbsp; Girls
      learned things like tumbling and scooters while boys were play football,
      baseball, and basketball.&nbsp; Even when laws were passed letting girls
      take part in athletics, things were still unfair. The feminist
      movement was the time period in which women decided to stand up and fight
      back</b>.</font></p>
