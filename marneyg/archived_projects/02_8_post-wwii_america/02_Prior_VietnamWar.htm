            not arrive until 1965.&nbsp; About 3 million men and women were sent

            Vietnam War.&nbsp; The American lived in constant tension at

            take over the South Vietnam and force communism on them.&nbsp; The
            united states feeling that the takeover getting to close sent troops
            over to South Vietnam to try and stop the takeover of
            communism.&nbsp; It was a questionable call by many when we sent the
            troops over to Vietnam.&nbsp; U.S. leaders were afraid that if they
            attacked the North Vietnam than it would cause tension between us
            and China and Russia and would start world war III.</td>

      cities but soon the anti-war protest were on every street corner in about
      every city in the U.S.&nbsp; The protest were at colleges.&nbsp; One
      protest at Kent State in Ohio four students were killed by National
      Guardsmen and students at Jackson State in Mississippi were also shot and

      South Vietnam signed a military and economic aid treaty with the U.S.
      leading to the arrive of the U.S. troops.&nbsp; The U.S. used many
      different weapons.&nbsp; Some were aircrafts and some were guns.&nbsp; One
      of the aircrafts was the Bell UH-1 helicopter it was a workhorse for
      America.&nbsp; It transported troops, equipment, and supplies.&nbsp; Another
      aircraft was designed in the late 1940s to carry nuclear bombs even though
      the B-52 preformed well in Vietnam.&nbsp; Some more aircrafts were
      Skyrader, Hercules, Skywarrior, Bird Dog, and Greyhound were just a few of
      the aircrafts used.&nbsp; They also used many guns one of the guns was a
      general purpose Machine Gun it was light enough to carry on patrol and
      deadly at fire.&nbsp; The headgear was steal helmets.&nbsp; The uniform
      was standard-issue cotton.&nbsp; Most of the time they wore jungle like
      boots. </td>
