      May 3rd- The pro-war, Republican Ohio Governor James Rhodes arrived at KSU
      for a tour of the damage and a news conference.&nbsp; He said KSU students were &quot;The worst type of
      people we harbor in America... worse than the Communist... We're going to eradicate
      the problem!&quot;&nbsp; James Rhodes sent in the National Guard.&nbsp;
      The unit that responded, mostly from Troop G and Company A, were badly
      trained and tired from just coming from a riot
      elsewhere.&nbsp; They attacked the students with tear gas and
      rifles.&nbsp; Several students and one disabled veteran
      were slashed and stabbed by bayonets for yelling and cursing at them from
      cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></td>

      By May 4th there were four hundred Ohio National Guardsmen in the city of Kent and
      eight hundred on campus.&nbsp; When the riot started at noon seventy five of the
      eight hundred attacked.&nbsp; They through tear gas canisters into the crowd that were
      thrown back.&nbsp; The crowd ran over &quot;Blanket
      Hill&quot; and into the Prentice Hall dormitory parking lot.&nbsp; The
      guardsmen stood in the practice football field
      for about ten minutes.&nbsp; Rocks were thrown by the protesters and then
      thrown back by the guards, since the crowds were over 100 feet away they
      were harmless to both sides.&nbsp; As the students
      walked closer about a dozen guardsmen kneeled and aimed.&nbsp; Then a
      couple of minutes later the troops regrouped and started to march back
      over the hill.&nbsp; At the top about twenty- eight turned around and fired.&nbsp;
      They shot their M-1 rifles into a crowd of unarmed
      students for thirteen long seconds.&nbsp; sixty- seven deadly bullets were fired all together.&nbsp;
      Thirteen students were shot four of which died.&nbsp; The other nine were badly
      injured.&nbsp; Most of the students were over 300 feet away.&nbsp; Out of
      the four killed only two were protesters.&nbsp; The other two were simply bystanders on their way to
      class.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>
