      <p align="left">World War II had a huge effect on the fashion of the
      40's.&nbsp; The War Production Board limited yardage use.&nbsp; Conserving
      materials became a significant issue.&nbsp; McCalls produced patterns that
      transformed men's suits into women's suits because women had to
      work.&nbsp; Women's dresses were changed into children's dresses with such
      patterns.&nbsp; For the first time skirts were at the knees to save
      materials.&nbsp; The skirts were straight and plain.&nbsp; Jackets were
      twenty-five inches or less in length, and nylon stockings were taken off
      the market.&nbsp; Introduced into fashion were co-ordinating separates.&nbsp;
      They served as an illusion that one had more outfits then what one really
      had.</p>

    <td width="50%" colspan="2">After WWII, fashion was deemed the &quot;New
      Look.&quot;&nbsp; They used as much fabric as they pleased, and used
      plenty of it.&nbsp; Skirts became a lot fuller and a lot longer in
      length.&nbsp; This brought the soft, feminine, romantic image to the
      40's.&nbsp; Vogue introduced Peplums in many varieties.&nbsp; There was
      lots of lace, ruffles, puffy sleeves, and buttons down the center.&nbsp;
      Corsets became outdated.&nbsp; Now there was two separate pieces- the bra
      and girdle.&nbsp; &quot;Bra&quot; became a new and widely used term.&nbsp;
      Bras&nbsp; had wire introduced to them once metal wasn't so scarce.&nbsp;
      Nylon stockings came back.&nbsp; There were leather platform shoes and
      handbags with nail heads and sportswear became a sensation.

      came full-cut trousers, full-cut clothing, long coats, and hand painted
      ties with images of skyscrapers, exotic foliage, ect.&nbsp; Introduced to
      fashion were casual shirts- Hawaiian/ Corisca shirts.&nbsp; These shirts
      were bright in colors and depicted with fruit, flowers, flames, women, and
      marine flora.&nbsp; Men stopped tucking in their shirts and stopped
      wearing jackets with everything.&nbsp; For those that wore jackets, they
      were loose fitting with pronounced shoulders or single breasted with three
      buttons.&nbsp; Sportswear was also very popular for men.
