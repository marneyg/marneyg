      told the Ervin Committee that Nixon had known of the cover up, and a month
      later Alexander Butterfield revealed that Nixon had recorded

      Watergate related conversations. The judge subpoenaed additional tapes.
      Nixon refused to bring them. The case then moved to The Supreme Court. The
      Supreme Court rued against him by an 8-0 vote. One of the tapes became
