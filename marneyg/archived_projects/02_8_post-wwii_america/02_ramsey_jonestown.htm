    <td width="100%" height="17" colspan="2"><b><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; James Warren Jones was
      born in Lynn, Indiana in 1931. He became a preacher in Indianapolis. When
      he preached he stood behind black glasses often stoned out of his mind on
      amphetamines and other drugs. He would preach for hours on the evils of
      capitalism, solidarity with the people of Vietnam, support for liberation
      struggles in the third world, and rail against racism in the U.S. He also spreader these messages through the Peoples Temple own radio program and
      their printing plant which published the Peoples Forum (one of the largest
      circulation newspapers in the entire bay area). Jones held degrees from
      both Indiana University and Butler University. He opened the first Peoples
      Temple, a Christian cult group made up of mostly black Americans, in
      Indianapolis, Ind. in the late 50's. After he opened it he left for nearly
      a year in 1961 and lived in prosperous and somewhat mysterious
      circumstances in Belo Horizontal (a small country city on the Brazilian
      coast). On his return to Indiana he announced the temples move to Northern
      California. In 1971 they moved to San Francisco. When he was accused of
      defrauding church members and magazine articles detailing ex-members
      stories of beatings and forced donations he moved to Guyana, later to be
      known as &quot; Jonestown,&quot; in 1977.</font></b></td>

      South Americas northern coast. The groups plan was to create an
      egalitarian agricultural community, but members learned it was more like a
      prison than anything else. Offenders would sweltered in a 6x4ft.
      underground enclosure known as&nbsp; &quot;The Box.&quot; Misbehaving
      children would be dangled head first into a well late at night. In May
      1978 Deborah Layton, a trusted financial lieutenant for Jones, slipped out
      of Guyana and went to the United States consulate and later to the
      newspapers with a warning that Jones was conducting drills for a mass
      murder suicide. There was hardly and government action until later when
      U.S. states congressman Leo Ryan, who was contacted by a number of
      relatives worried about their friends and family in the Peoples Temple,
      that he decided to lead an investigation of reporters and relatives to
      Jonestown. Ryan did a lot of research and talked to ex-members and family
      members. One family member he talked to was Sam Houston. Sam believes that
      his son Bob was killed because he had decided to announce that he was
      going to leave the temple. Sam was also concerned about his two
      granddaughters who were sent to New York for a vacation and somehow ended
      up in Guyana and never returned. Ryan also found that there were claims of
      social security, irregularities of human rights, and that people were
      being held against their will. He also found Jones was under at least a
      dozen investigations before his events in 1978. He had involvement in drug
      smuggling, gun running in the Caribbean, kidnapping, arson, money
      laundering, customs violations, welfare fraud, illegal broadcast if coded
      messages, abuse of tax-exempts status, forging trust deeds and even
      murder. Yet, somehow he still apparently managed to live a charmed life,
      and each of these inquiries was abandoned, stalled, botched, or
      compromised until it was to late. Jones also had more than twelve million
      dollars in cash amounts in the U.S., Canada, England, Switzerland, Panama,
      Venezuela and Jamaica with couriers shuffling suitcases of cash back and
      forth.</font></b></td>
