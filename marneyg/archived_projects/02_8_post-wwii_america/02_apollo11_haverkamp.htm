    <td width="50%"><font size="5">In July of 1969 the spacecraft Apollo 11 toke
      off for the moon.&nbsp; The objective of the mission was to &quot;Perform
      manned lunar landing and return mission safely.&quot;&nbsp; Which was achieved.&nbsp;
      Apollo 11 was launched July 16 at 9:32:00 a.m. from KSC, Florida Complex
      39-A.&nbsp; The commander of the mission was Neil A. Armstrong.&nbsp; The
      commander module pilot was Lt. Colonel Michael Collins.&nbsp; The lunar
      module pilot was Edwin E. Aldrin Jr.&nbsp; The first man on the moon was
      Neil Armstrong.&nbsp; Armstrong was backup commander for the flights
      Gemini 5,Gemini 11,and Apollo 8.&nbsp; He was commanding officer for the
      flights Gemini 8 and Apollo 11. On July 16,1969 Apollo 11 lifted
      off.&nbsp; Their velocity after launching from earth was 35,579 feet per
      second. While they were in space Edwin E. Aldrin said that six hours of
      intermittent sleep in orbit can be as good as six hours of uninterrupted
      sleep on Earth.&nbsp; While in space they got the &quot;2002&quot; message
      at 6,000 feet.&nbsp; Houston radioed &quot;Were go on that alarm.&quot;
      But engineer Steven Bales diagnosed the problem and recommended that the
      landing continue in a few seconds.&nbsp; They also had annoying ,computer
      related loses in communications with Earth.&nbsp; Because of uncertainties
      in both the gauges in the tanks and the estimates that could be made from telemeter
      data on the engine firing, the amount of time remaining until
      the fuel ran out was uncertain by about twenty seconds.&nbsp;If they got
      to low, Kranz would have to order a abort. It took a twelve-and-a-half
      minute decent burn to be able to land.&nbsp; When they
      were close to the moon and were getting ready the orbited it about 30
      times.&nbsp; Before they landed on the moon they had to get ready.&nbsp;The
      astronauts&nbsp; had to wear specially designed suits that were very heavy
      and bulky.&nbsp; They were made of a white, non-flammable material called
      beta cloth, a Teflon-coated fiberglass.&nbsp; this suit was made with
      twenty-five layers of protective materials which made the whole suit
      weight over one hundred and eighty pounds. But on the moon it only
      weighted thirty pounds.&nbsp;</font>

      <p><font size="5">They had landed in the sea of Tranquility.&nbsp; Their
      coordinates on the moons surface was .71 degrees North and 23.63 degrees
      East.&nbsp; At that spot they were 389,645 Km from Earth.&nbsp; After they were already to go Armstrong started
      down the ladder and he stepped on the moon.&nbsp; Aldrin radioed back to
      Houston saying &quot;One small step for man one giant leap for man
      kind&quot; Aldrin stayed in the craft and waited for about two and a half
      hours before he joined Armstrong on the moon.&nbsp; When Aldrin stepped on the
      moon he said is felt like a muddy dust and that he sank in about an inch.&nbsp;
      During their stay on the moon they collected forty-four pounds of rock, dirt,&nbsp;
      dust and other objects.&nbsp; They picked up these materials with specially
      made thongs, scoops, and shovels.&nbsp; They collected all of these
      materials so they can be observed at a lab. in Washington D.C.&nbsp; All
      the rock and soil materials were placed in vacuum tight containers.&nbsp; While
      the astronauts were on the moon they took photographs, collected materials
      samples, and set up many experiments.&nbsp; While they were on the moon at
      first they had a hard time walking but they finally got the hang of
      it.&nbsp; They spent twenty-one and a half&nbsp; hours on the moon.</font></p>

      with two seismic assemblies one long period seismometers with a seismic frequency
      response of 0.004 to 3 Hz and two short period seismic frequency response
      of 0.005 to 20Hz.&nbsp; The last one was shut off in 1981.</font></p>

      The Laser Ranging Retroreflector was built of silica cubes.&nbsp; Laser
      ranging beams from Earth were reflected back.&nbsp; It's job was to
      reflect a beam of light back on a parallel path to it's origin.&nbsp; It
      faced Earth.&nbsp; It permitted precise measurement of the distance
      between Earth and the moon by Three inches.&nbsp;</font> </p>

      sheet, 1.4 meters by 3 meters, that was deployed on a pole facing the sun
      for a period of seventy-seven minutes, allowing solar wind particles to
      embed themselves into the foil.&nbsp; The foil was then returned to Earth
      for Laboratory analysis.&nbsp; This allowed chemical composition of the
      embedded&nbsp;&nbsp; solar wind to be determined more accurately than
      would be possible if the measurement were made using remotely&nbsp;
      controlled instruments on the moon, but limited the periods at which
      observations could be made.&nbsp; The isotopes of the light noble gases
      were measured, including helium-3, helium-4, neon-20, neon-21, neon-22,
      argon-26.</font></p>
