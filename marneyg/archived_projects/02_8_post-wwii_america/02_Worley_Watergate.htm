      Nixon served as vice-president for eight years, then lost the 1960
      election to John F. Kennedy. He recovered from political defect to be
      chosen again as the Republican Party's candidate at the 1968 election.

      Watergate has entered the political lexicon as a term synonymous with
      corruption and scandal, and yet the Watergate Hotel is one of Washington's
      finest hotels. It was here that the Watergate Burglars broke into the
      Democratic Party's National Committee offices on June 17, 1972. If it had
      not been for the alert actions of Frank Wills, a security guard, the
