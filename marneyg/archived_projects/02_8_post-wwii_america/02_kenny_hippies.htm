      If you were wondering where the word hippie came from here's an answer. It
      was first used in new York but it wasn't hippie it was hipster (in the
      early 1950&quot;s). later in 1959 it was changed to hippie to be more
      convental. hippie weren't all bad they were known for many good things.
      One was movements that changed our history as we know it.</td>
