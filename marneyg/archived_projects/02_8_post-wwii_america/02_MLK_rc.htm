      <p><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="#008000">&nbsp;Five score years ago, a
      great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed the Emancipation
      Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope
      to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering
      injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of
      captivity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="#008000">&nbsp;But one hundred years
      later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One
      hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the
      manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred
      years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of
      a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is
      still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an
      exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an
      appalling condition.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="#008000">&nbsp;In a sense we have come
      to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our
      republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the
      declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which
      every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men
      would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the
      pursuit of happiness.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="#008000">&nbsp;It is obvious today that
      America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of
      color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America
      has given the Negro people a bad check which has come back marked
      &quot;insufficient funds.&quot; But we refuse to believe that the bank of
      justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient
      funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come
      to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of
      freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed
      spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to
      engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of
      gradualism. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of
      segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to open
      the doors of opportunity to all of God's children. Now is the time to lift
      our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of
      brotherhood.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="#008000">&nbsp;It would be fatal for the
      nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the
      determination of the Negro. This sweltering summer of the Negro's
      legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn
      of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a
      beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will
      now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to
      business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America
      until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of
      revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the
      bright day of justice emerges.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="#008000">&nbsp;But there is something
      that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads
      into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place
      we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our
      thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="#008000">&nbsp;We must forever conduct
      our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not
      allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and
      again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with
      soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro
      community must not lead us to distrust of all white people, for many of
      our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come
      to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny and their
      freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="#008000">&nbsp;And as we walk, we must
      make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are
      those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, &quot;When will you be
      satisfied?&quot; We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy
      with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the
      highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as
      the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We
      can never be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a
      Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we
      are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down
      like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="#008000">&nbsp;I am not unmindful that
      some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of
      you have come fresh from narrow cells. Some of you have come from areas
      where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of
      persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been

      freedom and justice.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="#008000">&nbsp;I have a dream that my
      four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged

      low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be
      made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh
      shall see it together.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="#008000">&nbsp;This is our hope. This is
      the faith with which I return to the South. With this faith we will be
      able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this
      faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation
      into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able
      to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail
      together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free
      one day.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="#008000">&nbsp;This will be the day when
      all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, &quot;My
      country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where
      my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let
      freedom ring.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Chiller" size="5" color="#008000">&nbsp;And if America is to be a
      great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the
      prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty
