      Brookline Massachusetts.&nbsp; He was the second of nine children and grew
      up looking up to his older brother Joseph.&nbsp; As a child he spent many
      hours in the park learning about history.&nbsp; He thought if he spent
      time with his grandpa than he wouldn't miss a thing.&nbsp; If he wasn't at
      the park he was playing with his brothers and sisters.&nbsp; As he was
      growing their fathers income was increasing.&nbsp; Most of his childhood
      was filled with studying, playing family games, and playing sports.&nbsp;
      He attended&nbsp; private schools in elementary none of which were
      parochial.&nbsp; He later spent a year at Canterbury school in New Milford
      Connecticut.&nbsp; After he spent 4 years at Choate school in Wallingford
      Connecticut.&nbsp; John played 12 sports none of which he made the
      varsity.&nbsp; When he graduated from Choate in 1935 he ranked 64th in a
      class of only 112.&nbsp; However a lot of his classmates picked him
      &quot;most likely to succeed&quot;.&nbsp; He spent the summer of 1935
      studying London school of economics.&nbsp; After that summer he entered
      Princeton university but had to leave because of an attack of jaundice.&nbsp;
      After he had to leave he entered Harvard University but hurt his back
      playing football.&nbsp; While he was there he had 2 trips to Europe one in
      in 1937 and 1939.</font>

      political power.&nbsp; In 1939his trip allowed him to stay in American Embassy's
      talking to some important people.&nbsp; He graduated cum laude from
      Harvard in June 1940.&nbsp; In 1941 he volunteered for the army but was
      turned down because he had a bad back from that football injury at
      Harvard.&nbsp; That summer he strengthened up by working out and running
      and in that September the Navy accepted him.&nbsp; He went to World War
      Two in the South Pacific, he earned a purple heart of courage for saving
      his crew by swimming them to shore after a Japanese boat rammed
      them.&nbsp; In June 1946 he announced his candidacy in the Democratic
      party.&nbsp; He began against nine other candidates some called him the
      &quot;poor little rich kid&quot; others saw him as an outsider.&nbsp; As a
      representative he was reelected in 1948 and 1950 but had mixed voting
      records.&nbsp; In April 1952 he ran candidacy for senate&nbsp; against
      Republican Henry Cabot Lodge JR. Kennedy's slogan was &quot;I will do more
      for Massachusetts&quot;.&nbsp; This was happening when Eisenhower was
      president and Kennedy won by more than 70,000

      12, 1953.&nbsp; Also in 1953 in the Boston area he advanced to
      senate.&nbsp; In 1955 while recovering from a back operation he wrote
      &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; which won him the Pulitzer Prize.&nbsp;
      Not long after marriage she had to help him through a serious illness plus
      his injured back.&nbsp; After his illness he went toward national and
      international issues.&nbsp; In 1956 he almost gained Democratic Vice
      President.&nbsp; He helped get a compromise among Northern and Southern
      positions on the civil rights bill passed in 1957.&nbsp; Three years later
      he was&nbsp; the first ballot nominee for President.&nbsp; One of his
      injunctions was at that time was &quot;Ask not what your country can
      do&nbsp; for you-- ask what you can do for your country.&nbsp; In 1961 he
      was elected the 35th President.&nbsp; After Russians installed missiles in
      Cuba, in 1962 he imposed a quarantine on all offensive weapons bound from
      Cuba.&nbsp; This meant that U.S. warships would halt and search Russians
      ships.&nbsp; He expressed his determination in these words &quot;This
      secret, swift and extraordinary build up of communist missiles in an area
      well known to have a special and historical relationship to the U.S. and
      the nations of Western Hemisphere-- is a deliberately provocative and
      unjustified change in the status quo which cannot be accepted by this
      country if our courage and our commitments are ever again to be trusted by
      either friend or foe.&quot;&nbsp; Then on October 28 after an exchange of
      notes between Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev, it was announced that the
      Soviet Union would withdraw its offensive weapons in Cuba.&nbsp; During
      that missile confrontation Kennedy received widespread international
      support and later was credited with having achieved a turning point
      favorable to the west in the war.&nbsp; In another tension he responded to
      the Soviet Union under nuclear tests.&nbsp; He urged them to join the
      United States and Britain in an agreement not to conduct tests in the atmosphere.&nbsp;
      On August 5, 1963 after negotiations the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet
      Union signed a limited nuclear test ban treaty forbidding atmospheric
      testing of nuclear weapons.&nbsp; This marked the first limitations of
      arms expansion since the cold war began.&nbsp; In&nbsp; Southeast Asia,
      the dominant threat of Chinese Communist domination forced the president
      to strengthened the defense of that area.&nbsp; Although limited numbers
      of the U.S. military advisers had been sent to the South Vietnam for
      anti-guerrilla operations since 1954 have increased in numbers under the
      Kennedy administration from about 700 to more than 1,5000.&nbsp; On a
      global scale, Kennedy established the peace corps, in March 1961 he
      authorized through this program headed by his brother-in-law, Sergeant
      Shriver, Many Americans were encouraged to value their skills to
      &quot;sharing in the great common task of bringing to man that descent way
      of life which is the foundation of freedom and a condition of
      peace&quot;.&nbsp; In anticipation of the growth of the European common
      market, he obtained from congress the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which
      granted him authority to bargain by offering drastic tariff
      reductions.&nbsp; &quot;Acting our own, by ourselves we cannot establish
      justice throughout the world&quot;, he asserted on July 4, 1962.&nbsp;
      &quot;But joined with other free nations, we can...assist the developing
      nations to throw off the yoke of poverty.&quot;&nbsp; In November 22 1963,
      he was on a speechmaking in Dallas they were riding and cheering enthusiastically
      as their open car passed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

      shots, striking Kennedy twice in the base of the head and neck and
      seriously wounding John Connelly, governor of Texas, who was riding with
      Kennedy.&nbsp; Kennedy was rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital.&nbsp;
      About a half hour later the president was announced dead.&nbsp; That day
      the police arrested Lee Harvey Oswald for the murder of Kennedy.&nbsp;
      Oswald had lived for a while in the Soviet Union.&nbsp; He killed Dallas
      policeman J.D. Tippet while resisting arrest.&nbsp; Two days later in the
      basement of the Dallas police station, Oswald was shot and killed by Jack
      Ruby a night club member.</font><font size="5">&nbsp; In 1979 the house
      assassinations committee after two years of investigation said that Lee
      Harvey Oswald probably was part of a conspiracy that also may have
