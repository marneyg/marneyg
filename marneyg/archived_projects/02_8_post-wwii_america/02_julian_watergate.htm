      Nixon's political career began in 1947 and ended when he became the first
      U.S. president to resign from office in 1974. He served as Eisenhower's
      vice-president for 8 years, then in 1960 he ran for president and lost to
      John F. Kennedy. He ran again in the 1969 election and won</font></td>

      In order to win the 1972 election, Nixon's reelection committee planned a
      break in at the democratic national committee in the Watergate hotel.
      During the night on June 17, 1972, 5 burglars broke into the democratic
      national committee offices and were arrested. All five suspects gave false
      names to the police after being arrested.</font></td>

      A special senate committee held televised hearings in which the former Whitehouse
      counsel, John dean, stated members of the Nixon administration
      had known of the Watergate burglary. They found that Nixon had taped
      conversations in the oval office. The special prosecutor requested those
      tapes to investigate the affair, Nixon fired him. The special prosecutor,
      Archebald Cox, had begun to uncover widespread evidence of political
      espionage by Nixon's reelection committee illegally wire tapping citizens
      by the administration.&nbsp; </font></td>

      The investigation of Watergate unraveled a web of political spying and
      sabotage, it established that no president is above the law. It also
      exposed a trial of abuses that led to the highest levels of the Nixon
      administration. The Watergate affair was a national trauma, a crisis that
      tested and affirmed the rule of law. On August 9, 1974 Richard M. Nixon resigned from office
      under the threat of impeachment. Vice-president Gerald Ford took his place
      and became the first president to ascend to both positions (Vice-president
      and President) without being elected.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
