      sweater with the poodle skirt, black and white t-shirts with rolled
      up&nbsp; sleeves, rolled up jeans, gold pedal pushers, ponytails, greased
      back ducktails, portable collars, bobby socks, two toned bucks, and of
      course the famous blck leather jackets with flipped up collars.&nbsp;
      While this is all true, there is more to the 1950's fashion then we think.

    <td width="100%" colspan="2">Baby doll pajamas, also known as shortie pajamas, were worn
      by females of all ages.&nbsp; They were a two piece summer nightwear
      consisting of a short, sleeveless with a round or square yoke with frill
      at the hem and balloon panties with frill at the leg openings.&nbsp; The
      panties were not always completely covered by the top.&nbsp; Baby doll
      pajamas got their name from&nbsp; the 1956 film &quot;Baby Doll&quot;
      because they were worn in the film.&nbsp; They also recieved their name
      because they resemble what real baby dolls wear.

      50's.&nbsp; They got their name because of the beat of their music and
      that they didn't want a middle-America lifestyle.&nbsp; They wanted a hip,
      'beaten' down way of life.&nbsp; The&nbsp; boys wore sloppy joe sweaters,
      baggy chinos, and leather huarachi sandals.&nbsp; They let their hair groe
      out.&nbsp; Girls wore black leotards, straight skirts, and sandals or
      ballet slippers.&nbsp; They had gamine or urchin haircuts.

      stockings.&nbsp; The name 'Bobby' sock came from the British slang for
      British Police officers.&nbsp; You were dubbed a Bobby Soxer if you wore
      bobby socks and listened to Frankie Sinatra.
