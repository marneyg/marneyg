        ghetto.&nbsp; Many families lived in one apartment, and were unable to
        purchase food on the open market.&nbsp; They

        allow enough food into the ghetto to&nbsp; keep them healthy. In which they
        only feed the Jews a bowl of soup a day to survive on. The Germans had
        made it their policy to keep the Jews on the attempt of starving. The Nazi
        occupation authorities had instructions to give Jews half of the weekly maximum
        of food allowance needed by a &quot;population which doesn't work worth

        &quot;non-productive&quot; elements to get ready for a
        &quot;resettlement&quot; program that would begin two days later. That
        order prevented widespread panic throughout the whole ghetto. The Jews
        that didn't have work cards tried to find them as soon as they possibly
        could. The head of the Jewish council committed suicide when he was
        ordered to organize the deportations. Also on the very same day a group
        of Jewish leaders got together to discuss whether or not to resist the
        orders. Most of them had decided not to, and most had thought that the
        Germans were going to take no more than 60,000 people. It was agreed to
        that the resistance would hasten simply to the end of the ghetto.
        Between the meeting and the middle of September the Nazis deported more
        than 300,000 Jews from the ghetto, and most of them were taken to a
        Treblinka death camp. By fall of 1942, almost all the factions in the
        ghetto decided to resist deportations in the future. Each of the
        political groups formed its own &quot;battle group&quot; which came from
        central commander Mordecai Anielewicz, 24 years old. The armed
        resistance got ready for the conflict by using shelters and bunkers. By
        suddenly deporting 6,500 Jews, the Nazis surprised the Jewish fighters
        in January 1943. But those Jews remaining knew by now that deportation
        meant death so they chose to resist. A Jewish Fighting Organization
        called ZOB was formed. It had consisted of 22 groups, each of the groups
        contained 20-30 men, boys, and some women. The group sent for weapons
        from the anti-Nazi Poles outside of the ghetto. They had been supplied
        with enough weapons to successfully stop deportation by attacking from
        rooftops, cellars, and attics. They had killed 20 Germans and wounded 50
        as a result. The Jewish resistance, combined with severe winter weather
        and a shortage of trains, it prevented the SS from meeting Himmler's
        February deadline.</font></td>

        surrounded by the Nazis. There was more than 2,000 Waffen SS soldiers
        under the command of General Jurgen Stroop attacked the Jews. The German
        were armed&nbsp; with two armored cars, a tank, 3 light anti-aircraft
        guns, one medium howitzer, flame throwers, heavy and light machine guns,
        rifles, grenades, and pistols were up against only 700-750 Jewish
        resistance fighters. The Jews had managed to stock up on a few thousand
        grenades, and a few hundred rifles, pistols and revolvers. But they had
        only a few light machine guns. They also had Molotov cocktails. The plan
        for the Germans was to clear out 60,000 Jews in 3 days, but Jews hoped
        to hold out as long as they possibly could. The Jews had killed 12
        Germans. The Germans renewed the attack. They found it was difficult to
        kill or even capture the small battle groups. The ones that fought, then
        retreat through a maze of cellars, sewers, and many different other
        passageways to escape being captured. By the 5th Himmler was infuriated
        so he ordered the SS to brush out the ghetto&quot; with the greatest
        severity and relentless tenacity.&quot; So the SS General Stroop had
        decided just to burn down the entire ghetto block by block. By April
        22nd, fire was demolishing several parts of the ghetto, which was
        forcing many Jews to jump out of burning buildings. Into the next few
        days, the Germans were capturing and killing more and more of the ghetto
        Jews. Which Germans had reported that some resistance fighters in
        bunkers became &quot;insane from the heat, the smoke, and the
        explosions.&quot;&nbsp; Even though some Jews had tried to escape through
        the sewers the Germans had responded by using poison gas and blowing up
        the manholes. Anielewicz was killed on May 8th. It was clear that the
        ghetto fighters had been defeated on May 15th when shooting had become
        so intermittent.</font></td>
