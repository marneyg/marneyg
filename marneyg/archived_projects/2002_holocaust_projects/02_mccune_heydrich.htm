        Heydrich&nbsp; was born in Halle Germany on March 7,1904. His full name
        was Reinhard Eugen Tristan Heydrich. Heydrich grew up in a musical
        environment. His farther opened Halle Conservatory of Music, and his
        Mother was an accomplished pianist. Heydrich spent much of his time
        training with the violin. Heydrich soon developed a lifelong passion for
        the instrument. Heydrich had a very elegant home in Halle. Heydrich was
        often a target of schoolyard bullies. He was constantly teased about his
        high, pitched voice, and about rumored Jewish ancestry. Heydrich's
        parents were strong believers in harsh punishment. Because of this he
        was&nbsp; sullen, withdrawn, and unhappy in his early life. He was in
        excellent student who often excelled and had good marks. He was also an
        excellent athletic participant. When he was young he was an excellent
        fencer who won many awards.</font></td>

        often called &quot;billy goat&quot;. In 1926 he was promoted to Second
        Lieutenant and was assigned as a signal officer on a battle ship called,
        Schleswig Holstein. When Heydrich was off duty he was often chasing
        women or drinking. After one such night he met a shipyard director's
        daughter with whom he spent the night. Later on another evening he met
        his Fiancé. The shipyard director's daughter got angry and told her
        father. Later Heydrich was discharged with &quot;Conduct Unbecoming of an
        Officer&quot;.</font></td>

      <font FACE="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">At the age of 27 Heydrich was
      interviewed by Himmler. After the interview Heydrich was picked to run an
      intelligence agency for the SS. It all started with a small room with one
      typewriter. Reinhard had informers who watched top Nazi officials or
      anyone who might oppose Hitler, Heydrich kept folders on all of the top
      German officials. These folders had personal and other forms of
      information. By December 1931he was promoted to SS major. Heydrich saw
      that many arrests were made by his henchmen. Those who were arrested were Communists,
      Catholics, and others that at some time might oppose Hitler. On the Night
      of Long Knives many top SA officials were hunted down and murdered on
      Heydrich's order. Many of Heydrich's henchmen used torture, murder, indiscretion
      arrests, extortion, and blackmail to crush anti-Nazis and to gain
      information. October 9-10 was Kristallnacht (The Night of Broken Glass).
      On these two horrible days 25,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration
      camps. This report was written by Heydrich to Himmler:</font>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">&quot;The event of
      destruction of Jewish shops and houses cannot yet be verified by
      figures...815 shops destroyed... 171 dwellings set on fire or destroyed
      only indicate a fraction of the actual damage so far as arson is concerned...
      119 synagogues were set on fire another 76 completely destroyed... 25,000
      Jews were arrested... 36 deaths were reported and those seriously injured
      were also numbered at 36. Those injured are Jews.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
