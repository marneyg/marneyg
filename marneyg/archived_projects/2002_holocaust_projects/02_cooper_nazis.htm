        they introduced many new methods in the field.&nbsp; The Nazis made use
        of all means at their disposal to achieve.&nbsp; For example, in the

        the Political Workers' Circle.&nbsp; The Political Workers' Circle was a
        small right-wing group that met Beginning in November 1918.&nbsp; The
        leader was Anton Drexler, who was a locksmith at the locomotive works in
        Munich.&nbsp; It was also led by Kar Harrer, who was a racist reporter
        and member of the volkish-mystical Thule Society.&nbsp; A rabid anti-Semitism
        characterized its meetings.&nbsp; In1919 this circle became
        the German Workers' Party.&nbsp; Its foundation marked the start of the development
        of politically organized national socialism.&nbsp; In
        early1920, it was renamed the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche
        Arbieterpartei meaning National Socialist German Workers' Party.&nbsp;
        Hitler joined the party on September 12, 1919.&nbsp; He became its
        leader in 1921.&nbsp; The Nazis were inspired by Hitler to dislike all
        Jews and kill them.</font> </td>

        brown shirts and carried weapons.&nbsp; They had arm bands that sported
        the swastika,&nbsp; a mystic symbol of ancient origin.&nbsp; It is in
        the shape of a cross with each arm bent back in a ninety degree angle
        and pointing clockwise.&nbsp; It indicated the four directions of the
        earth.&nbsp; It implied world conquest and also served as a symbol of anti-Semitism.&nbsp; By 1935, 60 percent of Germany's youth had joined
        Hitler's youth movement.&nbsp; They joined at the age of ten.&nbsp; Boys
        were indoctrinated in all aspects of Nazi ideology and brainwashed in anti-Semitism.&nbsp; Later encouraged to translate ideas into action,
        they became active participants in Germany's mass murder of European
        Jews.&nbsp; The storm troopers were the main instrument in the Nazi
        party for aiding Hitler's rise to power.&nbsp; The storm troopers were a
        huge force during the Nazi regime.&nbsp; The Nazis had 10,000 storm
        troopers by 1923.</font> </td>
