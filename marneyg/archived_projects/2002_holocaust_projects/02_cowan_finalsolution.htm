        Hitler committed suicide and also did Himmler.&nbsp; Before they
        committed suicide, they had all the Nazis try to hide their
        extermination camps by blowing up the crematoriums, gas chambers, and
        everything else.&nbsp; However they didn't succeed in doing this.&nbsp;
        The Allies invaded and found the remains.&nbsp; Some are still standing
