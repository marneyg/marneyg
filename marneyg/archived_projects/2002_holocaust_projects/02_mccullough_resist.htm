      <td width="100%">During the Holocaust, the Jews tried, every now and then,
        to resist the Nazis.&nbsp; All resistance to the Holocaust was
        amazing.&nbsp; You are most likely to think of resistance as the destruction of an ammo dump or a base, but in the
        Holocaust, even hiding a diary was resistance.&nbsp; Resistance could be
        from suicide running, hiding, trying to survive, or attacking the
        Nazis.&nbsp; Another would be to let them kill you be attacking the
        Germans who were trying to take you to
        death camps.&nbsp; Resistance could also be in trying to carry on a
        &quot;normal&quot; life by talking, playing cards, singing, dancing,
        acting, or even just playing music for one another.&nbsp; Also, trying
        to carry on religion or teaching children to resist the Nazis.&nbsp;
        Most attempts against the Nazis failed, but some did work.&nbsp; Jews
        died from resistance.&nbsp; A lot of them who were hiding, were caught
        and killed.&nbsp; Jews going to neutral countries were shot.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">&nbsp;Smuggling was considered resistance, but it really
        became a pastime for Jews.&nbsp; It also supplied food, items, and
        weapons for Jews.&nbsp; It was use in the Warsaw Ghetto as well as other
        camps.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">Humor, believe it or not, was in ghettos and death
        camps.&nbsp; Jokes were made to make fun of Hitler, the Holocaust, and
        the Nazis.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; A police officer comes into a Jewish
        home and want to confiscate the possessions.&nbsp; The woman cries,
        pleading she is a widow and has a child to support.&nbsp; The officer
        agrees on one condition- that she guesses which of his eyes is the
        artificial one.&nbsp; &quot;The left one,&quot; guesses the woman.&nbsp;
        &quot;How did you now?&quot; he asks.&nbsp; &quot;Because that one has
        the human look,&quot; she responds.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">Many Jews in ghettos were forced to work in war
        industries for the Germans.&nbsp; This only lead to more
        resistance.&nbsp; Like in one ghetto, Jews found away to thwart the
        Germans effort of war by sewing uniforms incorrectly so they could not
        be worn.</td>

        took arms where killed. Above was after the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. A
        few were took to a death camp.</i></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">Although most most attempts of resistance were
        nonviolent, there were armed resistance.&nbsp; In the Warsaw Ghetto,
        Jews bribed guards for weapons, smuggled them, stole them, and made
        crude weapons.&nbsp; They learned how to make Molotov cocktails, pipe
        bombs, and homemade bombs to throw at tanks and solders.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">In Treblinka, there was some acts of resistance which
        were started by Meir Berliner who attacked and killed Unterschanfuhrer
        Max Bialas with a knife.&nbsp; 160 Jews died of the murder of one S.S.
        man.&nbsp; After this a girl, in a group about to be gassed, grabbed a
        riffle from a guard and killed one man and wounded two others.&nbsp; She
        was caught, tortured, and killed.&nbsp; Also, on August 4, 1943, 700
        Jews blew up part of a camp. all but 150-200 Jews died, and over 20
        Germans died.&nbsp; only 12 of these Jews survived World War II.&nbsp;
        Then, on September 3, 1942, in the Tuchin Ghetto, 700 Jews tried to
        escaped to Ukraine, but only 15 lived.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">Not all Germans were against the Jews.&nbsp; In fact, some Germans
        tried to save Jews. Like in one village, Le Chambon-sur-Lignon was was
        entirely different than that of other village.&nbsp; It was a village
        that hid Jews from Nazis. Also, people saved Jews, like Yad Vashem, who
        honored over 11,000 rescuers of Jews.&nbsp; Another is Oskar Schindler
        who used Jewish slaves to acquire a fortune, and then used his fortune
        to save the lives of his slaves.

    <tr>
      <td width="100%">Some Jews who were able to escape from ghettos and camps
        went to wooded areas where they formed their own fighting units.&nbsp;
        These fighters, or partisans, in occupied Soviet territory, hid in a
        forest near the Lithuanian capital of Vilna.&nbsp; They were able to
        derail hundreds of trains and kill over 3,000 Germans soldiers.
 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">A partisan life in the forest was difficult.&nbsp; People
        had to move from place to place to avoid discovery, raid farmers' food
        supplies to eat, and try to survive winter in flimsy shelters built from
        logs and branches.
