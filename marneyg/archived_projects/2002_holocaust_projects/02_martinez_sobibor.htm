        part of operation Rienhard. The location of the camp was in the Lublin
        District of Eastern Poland it was about a kilometer from the river Bug.
        Its general isolation and proximity to a railway is why they chose to
        construct the camp there in March of 1942. The staff of the camp
        consisted of about 20 SS men and about 100 Ukranian guards.</font></b></td>

        not only to keep prisoners from escaping, but also to keep people from
        approaching and contacting the prisoners. Sobibor was divided into four
        sections and a pre-camp where the Jews had worked and lived while they
        stayed in the camp. Lager 1 is where the Jews had worked and lived while
        they stayed in the camp. Lager 2 is where the camp prison workers sorted
        and stored goods. In the &quot;barbersbarack&quot; is where the
        prisoners got their hair cut when they arrived. In between Lager 2 and Lager
        3 is where the landing strip was, where airplanes could land and take
        off when bringing prisoners in. Lager 3 is where the gas chambers were where the Jews had been
