        agenda when Germany hosted the 1936 XI Olympic Games in Berlin. Hitler
        planned to amaze foreign spectators with Germany's Aryan
        &quot;supreme&quot; master-race.&nbsp; He wanted to strengthen the
        German Aryan race and prepare Germany's youth for war.&nbsp; He thought
        it was his great chance to convince the world of the superiority of the
        Aryan race.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><p</td>

        two years later Nazi Party leader Adolph Hitler would become chancellor

        supporter after Joseph Goebbels, his minister of propaganda, convinced
        him of their propaganda value.&nbsp; The regime provided full financial

        Olympic revival will be undermined if individual countries are allowed
        to restrict participation by reason of class, creed, or
        race.&quot;&nbsp; Brundage, like many others in the Olympics movement,
        initially considered moving the Games from Germany.&nbsp; After a brief
        and tightly managed inspection of German sports facilities in 1934,
        Brundage stated publicly that Jewish athletes were being treated fairly
        and that the Games should go on, as planned.&nbsp; Debate over
        participation in the 1936 Olympics was greatest in the United
        States.&nbsp; Brundage opposed this, because he arqued that politics had
        no place what so ever in sport, saying, &quot;The Olympic Games belong
        to the athletes and not to the politicians.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

        the Olympics with colorful posters and magazine spreads.&nbsp; Athletic
