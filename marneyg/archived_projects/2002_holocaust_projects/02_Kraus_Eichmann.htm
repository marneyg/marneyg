      <td width="100%" colspan="2">Adolf Eichmann the son of Adolf Karl Eichmann and Marie
        nee Schefferling was born in 1906 in Solingen, Germany.&nbsp; His family
        moved to Austria when he was eight.&nbsp; He spent his youth in Linz,
        Austria, which had also been Hitler's home town.&nbsp; His mother died
        when he was ten.&nbsp; He had one sister and five brothers.&nbsp; He
        told
        an interviewer that his best childhood friend, Harry Selbar, was
        Jewish.&nbsp; As a boy, Eichmann was teased about his looks and
        complexion and was nicknamed ''the little Jew'' by classmates.&nbsp; He
        was a poor student and dropped out of High School to become a traveling
        Sales man with a Vacum cleaner company between 1927-1933.He later took a
        job with an American oil company.&nbsp; </td>

        joined the exiled Austrian legion in July 1933.&nbsp; From 1934-1937 he
        worked for the security Service (SD).&nbsp; Eichmann's first big
        opportunity came after he was sent to Vienna by the Gestapo to prepare
        the ground for the Anschlass, when he was Appointed.&nbsp; In August
        1938 he was in charge of the office for Jewish Emigration.&nbsp; In
        March 1939 he was handling forced deportations to Poland.&nbsp; In
        October 1939 he was appointed special adviser on the ''evacuation'' of
        Jews and Poles.&nbsp; In&nbsp; December 1939 Eichmann was transferred to
        Reich Main security office (RSHA).&nbsp; For&nbsp; the next six years
        Eichmann's&nbsp; office was the headquarters for the implementation of
        the ''Final Solution''.&nbsp; In the summer of 1941 his department began
        creating death camps, developing gassing techniques and organizing the
        system of convoys that were to take European Jews to their deaths.

      <td width="100%" colspan="2">It was in 1941 and&nbsp; November of the same year that
        he was promoted to SS Lieutenant-Colonel.&nbsp; He had begun to organize
        the Mass deportation of Jews from Germany already, the Bohemia, in
        accordance with Hitler’s order to make the Reich free of Jews as
        rapidly as possible.&nbsp; Eichmann’s position as the “Jewish
        specialist” was consolidated in January of 1942.&nbsp; Implementation
        of the “Final Solution” was a model of bureaucratic industriousness.&nbsp;
        Eichmann claimed he had nothing against Jews.&nbsp; Eichmann ignored
        Himmlers order of “no gassing”.&nbsp; The desk-murderer became a
        public personality after March 1944.&nbsp; In August 1944 approximately
        four million Jews had died in death camps and two million had been
        killed by mobile extermination units.&nbsp; Eichmann was arrested at the
        end of the war.&nbsp; In 1946 he escaped from an American internment
        camp and went to Argentina.&nbsp; Israeli secret agents tracked him down
        on May 2, 1960.&nbsp; December 2, 1961 Eichmann was sentenced to death
        for crimes against humanity.&nbsp; On May 31, 1962 he was executed in
        Ramleh prison.&nbsp; World War II began in September of 1939 when
        Germany attacked Poland, Europe’s largest Jewish population.&nbsp;
        Eichmann gave German troops orders to kill Jews which might be a
        security threat.&nbsp; Eichmann denied that he suggested ghettoization
        as a method to kill large numbers of Jews.&nbsp; In October 1939 was
        when Eichmann started Jews, Poles, and Gypsies.&nbsp; Thousands of
        people in these ghettos died of starvation and disease.&nbsp; If they
        survived they were deported to labor concentration or death camps.&nbsp;
        Not very many survived.&nbsp; Eichmann hoped that the ghettos would
        deplete the Jewish population quickly and naturally.&nbsp; There was no
        medicine permitted in the ghettos.&nbsp; In 1940 Henryk Ross
        photographed the brutal conditions there.&nbsp; The photos were taken by
        Ross and others.&nbsp; They painted of ghetto life.&nbsp; There were one
        hundred and sixty thousand people there that were packed into a smaller
        area than three square miles.&nbsp; When Eichmann forced another twenty
        thousand in to Lodz, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1941.&nbsp;
        There was some special German units called Einsatzgruppen.&nbsp; The
        units called Einsatzgruppen were followed immediately behind the
        advancing troops.&nbsp; Under the orders from Eichmann the units hunted
        down the Jews and killed them.&nbsp; Eichmann was the supervisor of
        these units.&nbsp; The main and principal objective of the
        Einsatzgruppen was to kill the Jews and rob them from their property.&nbsp;
        The estimated about 1.4 million Jews were murdered by the Einsutzgruppen.&nbsp;
        All of their reports about their activities went to Eichmann.&nbsp; In
        October 1941 there was a decision that was made to use a poison to kill
        the Jews.&nbsp; Auschwitz was a camp in Poland that was chosen to test
        the new method and by the end of 1941 zyclon B gas was found to be a
        faster method than carbon monoxide poisoning.&nbsp; It is generally
        believed that the number of Jews that died in the Holocaust was six
        million.&nbsp; Five million of the others also perished as a result of
        Nazi atrocities.

        On a frigid winter evening in 1960, Israeli secret agent Peter Z. Malkin
        tracked Adolf Hitler outside the Nazi war criminals home in Buenos
        Aires, Argentina, then helped colleagues hustle Eichmann into a waiting
        car.&nbsp; Two weeks later, Eichmann, Adolf Hitler’s chief architect
        of the Holocaust, sat in an Israeli prison cell, awaiting his trial for
        war crimes and his eventual hanging in 1962.&nbsp; “I am not the
        monster that I am made out to be.&nbsp; I am the victim as an error of
        judgment.&nbsp; I was assaulted in Buenos Aires, tied to a bed for a
        week, and then drugged by injections in my arms and brought to the
        airport in Buenos Aires, form there I was flown from Argentina.&nbsp;
        This can quite obviously only be explained by the fact that I was
        considered to be the person who was responsible for everything.”&nbsp;
        In 1950 Eichmann along with 3 others went to Austria and then Italy.&nbsp;
        In Genoa a monk gave Eichmann a passport with the name Ricardo Klement
        obtains and Argentina Visa and goes to Buenos Aires.&nbsp; In April 1952
        Eichmann obtains his false identity documents.&nbsp; He is now Ricardo
        Klement a German national born in Bolzana, Italy.&nbsp; He is a mechanic
        employed as a labor organizer by the Capri construction, measurements,
        and water works company, which sheltered many ex-Nazis after the war.
