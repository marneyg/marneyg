        the time that was over 67% of Jewish&nbsp; workers and Jewish stores
        where burnt to the ground. Here is one of the speeches that Hitler said:</font>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00">&quot;When I went, I began to see Jews, and the more I saw Jews
            the more they became distinguished in my eyes from the humanity, Particularly,
            the inner city and north of the Danube Canal swarmed with people in
            which even outwardly had lost all resemblance to the German.&nbsp;</font></p>

        most of the Jewish workshops windows had been broken out and burnt to
        the ground they called this the &quot;Night of Broken Glass." After the

        good shape they would be taken into to work for the SS or Hitler. Over
        thousands of Jews where being transported from Lubin to Trebling a day. Hitler
        didn't do the extermination camps he almost always authorized Himmler
        for the SS Einsatzgruppen. They didn't lose very many Jews to where they
        where going because the SS and Himmler traveled in big groups that way
        if there was a problem they could kill the Jews in war. They put some of
        the Jews in big or little army trucks and locked them up.&nbsp;</font></td>
