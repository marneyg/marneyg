        Auschwitz was a death camp posing as a forced labor camp. It was
        rectangular in shape, and was surrounded by electrically charged barbed
        wire fences… lots of fences, and on these fences signs read - &quot;EXTREME
        DANGER, HIGH VOLTAGE, ELECTRIC WIRES&quot;. Auschwitz had several guard
        towers with about 405,000 labor prisoners from which 340,000 prisoners
        died from either starvation, beating, execution, or sickness. Of 405,000
        labor prisoners there was only about 65,000 prisoners who survived.</font></p>

        a survivor of Auschwitz, arrived at Auschwitz by a cattle car (by which

        on their luggage, and that he and his family found some water and no
        food on the their train ride to Auschwitz and that when they arrived
        everyone was marched up and down the isles for about 4 –5 hours. Once
        inside, everyone had to turn over all prized possessions, such as
        wedding ring and lockets and put them into a large box. Rudy had to give
        up his leather jacket and regretted giving it up. Rudy's father said to
        him, &quot;Son, if we ever get out of here I will buy 10 leather
        jackets.&quot;</font></p>

        about 2-3 hours. If someone was missing or the officer miss-counted then
        he/she would recount over and over again. Then if some one was missing, the prisoners
        would have to stand or kneel (outside) until he/she was found (usually
        dead in their bunks), sometimes this took 6-7 hours.</font></p>

        windows with barbed wire across them. People started pulling out the
        barbed wires and were jumping out the windows, everyone took a chance if
        they could because they knew that they were going to camp Belzac. Even
