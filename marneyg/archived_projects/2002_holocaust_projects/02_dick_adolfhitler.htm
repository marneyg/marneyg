        Adolf Hitler was born on April 20,1889 at Branau, Upper Australia at
        6:30 p.m. He was part Jewish from his Grandfather, and he was best known
        as the Nazi leader during World War II. </font></td>

        Hitler's father was Alois Hitler, and when Alois was 51, Adolf was
        born.&nbsp; When Adolf was&nbsp; a boy, his father wanted him to be into
        buiseness, but Adolf wanted to be an artist so he spent most of his time
        daydreaming, reading, or drawing.&nbsp; While Hitler was in Vienna he
        went to political events, and he had started to hate Jews and
        Slaves.&nbsp; After Hitler moved to Munich, Germany, and the Austrian
        Army gave him a call for a physical examination, but was found
        unfit.&nbsp; Hitler then was accepted by the German Army, after
        volunteering.&nbsp; He was a messanger for the most part of the World War
        I on the Western Front.&nbsp; He was decorated twice for bravery after
        being wounded.&nbsp; He was put in a military army for being temperarily
        blind from mustard gas.</font></td>

        Hitler began to gain power in political issues in 1919 after World War
        I.&nbsp; Hitler made his followers believe that he could win Germany's
        past glory back.&nbsp; Hitler promised Germany a mighty empire that
        would be around for one thousand years.&nbsp; At his emotional speeches
        people chanted, &quot;Hail Hitler&quot;.&nbsp; Adolf Hitler ruled
        Germany as Dictator from 1933-1945.&nbsp; &quot;Have no pity! Act
        brutally!&quot; is what Hitler told his soldiers.&nbsp; Hitler was able
        to lie, cheat, and even flatter to get power.&nbsp; He mainly blamed all
        of Germany's problems on the Jews.</font></td>

        The only thing that really stood out in front of Hitler's absolute power
        of Germany was the German President Paul von Hindenburg.&nbsp; Hitler
        thought that he should succeed Hindenburg as Fuhrer.&nbsp; Hindenburg
        had wrote a letter to Hitler that was telling him that he wanted to have
        the government to be a monarchy, after Hindenburg's death.&nbsp; Hitler
        would not back down from his Nazism and change to a monarchy
        government.&nbsp; Hindenburg had died on August 2, 1934 at 9:00 a.m.</font></td>

        Then the Nazi Reichstag announced this law: &quot;The Reich Government
        has enacted the following law which is here by promulgated.&nbsp;
        Section 1.&nbsp; The office of Reich President will be combined with
        that of Reich Chancelor.&nbsp; The existing authority of Reich President
        will consequently be transferred to the Fuhrer and Reich Chancellor ,
        Adolf Hitler.&nbsp; He will select his deputy.&nbsp; Section 2.&nbsp;
        This law is effective as of the time of the death of Reich President von
        Hindenburg.&quot;&nbsp; This law was illegal because it violated
        provisions in Germany's Constitution.&nbsp; It didn't matter though
        because Hitler was the law.&nbsp; Hitler's German officers had to swear
        this oath: &quot;I swear by God this sacred oath: I will render
        unconditional obedience to Adolf Hitler the Fuhrer of the German Reich
        and people, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, and will be ready as
        a brave soldier to risk my life at any time for this oath.&quot;</font></td>

        General Werner von Blomberg offered to have the army refer to Hitler as
        the &quot;Mein Fuhrer&quot; instead of &quot;Heir Hitler,&quot; and
        Hitler accepted. Hindenburg had sent Hitler a letter of will and
        testament that he wanted to have a Kaiser Monarchy.&nbsp; Hitler had
        destroyed the letter and ignored it.&nbsp; The Nazis had copied
        theletter and made it accountable.&nbsp; The German people voted 90% for
        Hitler.&nbsp; After Hitler's suicide, his will and testament was
        found.&nbsp; It said this: &quot; I nominate as my executor my most
        faithful Party comrade, Martin Bormann.&nbsp; He is given full legal
        authority to make all decisions.&nbsp; He is permitted to take out
        everything that has a sentimental value or is necessarie for the
        maintenance of a modest simple life, for my brothers and
        sisters.&quot; </font>
