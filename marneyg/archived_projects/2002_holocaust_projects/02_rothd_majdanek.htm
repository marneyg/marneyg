        The Majdanek
        Concentration Camp is located about 3 miles from the Polish city of
        Lublin. The decision to make the camp came from Heinrich Himmler during
        his visit to Lublin in July 1941. The Nazis brought in 2,000 Soviet POWs
        to build the camp. With no barracks these prisoners were forced to sleep
        and work in the cold outdoors with no water and no toilets.

        the harvest festival. The reason this was the worst incident was because
        18,000 Jews were murdered in a single day. The SS men shot the Jews in a
        group of one hundred. They were shot in pits while loudspeakers played

        While it sill
        was a Nazi camp, conditions at Majdanek were much worse than any other
        concentration camp. Majdanek had no sewer system in the camp. They had
        no toilets they had to just go on the ground. At night when the
        prisoners were forbidden to leave the barracks, they used wooden
        buckets. In Lublin the civil authorities would not let the camp be
        connected to the main sewer line, but in May 1942 Majdanek finally got a
        sewer system. And in 1943 the camp got running water, but the prisoners
        got only one shower or bath a month. This lack of sanitation caused many
        deaths from deceases like typhus, tuberculosis, and dysentery.

        The Germans
        could not shut down Majdanek in such an orderly fashion. With the
        Russian army advancing westward the Germans evacuated the camp in March
        1944. About 15,000 prisoners were transported I trains to camps in
        Europe like Auschwitz, Gross-Rosen, Ravensbruck, Natzwiler, Mathausen,
        Lodz, and Plaszow. And about another 1,000 prisoners weremarched off by
        foot just the day before the liberation.And some prisoners that were to
        ill to walk were abandoned at Majdanek.

        &nbsp; When the Russians overran the
        camp in July 23, 1944 they finally saw the horror of the death camps.
        They brought in representatives from the International Red Cross and the
        news media to view the gas chambers, crematoria, and the survivors,
        which were a little less than skeletons. But after all that the United
        States and Great Britain hesitated to believe what had happened. The
        Germans did not want a repeat of Majdanek. So through the last half of
        1944, the Germans worked furiously to complete their deadly work in
        preparation for the evacuation of Auschwitz the last remaining death
        camp.

        trial of the Nazi war criminals in 1946, the Soviets charged the Nazi
        leaders at Majdanek with killing only 1.5 million people at Majdanek. By
        1960 the number of people murdered by the Nazis at Majdanek declined to
        350,000. This was corrected by the guidebook, when it was learned that
        no more than 300,000 people had even been sent to Majdanek. The actual
