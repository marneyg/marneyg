      He didn't want to get a job. He learned about extreme political idea

      while for money. In WW1 1914 he volunteered for a Bavarnunt in German Army. He
      was temporarily blinded.&nbsp; He turned to politics
      after the war.  He began to focus on German workers party (Nazi party) on
      Feb.24,1920 he spoke to 2000.He was the parties most successful recruiter.
      In 1921,he had enough support to call himself fuehrer. On November 8, 1923
      Hitler and 600 started a revolution to take over the Government. He failed
      and was sentenced to five years for treason, but served only one. while in
      prison he wrote Meinkamf. The book Meinkamf is Hitler's interpretation of
      his youth, his political ideals, how he felt about race, and future plans
      for Germany. Meinkamf means my struggle. The book goes into detail on Hitler's
      racial philosophy. He strongly believed in the Aryan race which he
      described as, a Germanic man with fair skin, blond hair, blue eyes. He
      states the Aryans being the supreme form of human being, the master race.   The
      inferior race he believed to be the Jews, Slavic people, meaning
      Czech, Polish, and the Russians. He did not believe in the equality of the
      races. Hitler's plans included the taking of their lands by force and
      using them for German enslavement, or to be eliminated. His goal was world
      domination by the German race. The race he loathed the worst was the Jews
      , throughout his writings he refers to them as parasites ,lairs, dirty
      without any culture, a maggot repulsive and the mortal enemy of the
      Aryans. This competition he had between the Jews and the Aryans would
      become the beliefs of the Nazi Germany and
      would spread., soon it would be taught in schools. When Meinkamf was
      first distributed in 1925, it didn't sell. After Hitler became Chancellor
      of Germany, Millions of copies were sold. </td>

    <td width="100%">When the stock market collapsed on Wall Street on Tuesday,
      October 29, 1929, it hurt the economic market worldwide.&nbsp; The German
      economy was especially effected because it was built out of foreign
      capital.&nbsp; The majority being loans from America and trade.&nbsp; When
      German exports were not going anywhere in the world, that halt industrial
      production.&nbsp; Workers were laid off, banks failed.&nbsp; Overnight the
      middle class families were cast into poverty and misery.&nbsp; Everyone
      was looking for a solution.&nbsp; Hitler knew his opportunity he was
      waiting for arrived.&nbsp; He had change strategic tactics and instead of
      using force ,he tried politics. He was very good at speech and knew what
      the people wanted to hear.   He began to appeal to industrialist, and upper
      middle class socialites. Early in 1932,President Hindenburg reluctantly
      agreed to run for re-&nbsp; election despite his age and health. Hitler
      decided to oppose him, his slogan was &quot;Freedom and Bread&quot;.
      Joseph Goebbels helped him campaign. He scheduled numerous speeches, sent
      and distributed propaganda plastered posters everywhere. On March 13,1932
      Hitler got thirty percent of the votes in the election Hindenburg got
      forty- nine of the votes but failed enough of a majority. A run off
      election took place a month&nbsp;&nbsp; later. On April 10,1932 the people
      voted and gave Hitler 13,418,547 thirty-six percent of the vote.  Hindenburg
      got 19,359,983 fifty-three percent. The eighty-five year old President was

    <td width="100%"> On march 15,1933 Hitler's goal to legally establish a
      dictatorship was in &nbsp; reach. A meeting was held on how to obstruct
      what was left of the democrat&nbsp; process to get an Enabling Act passed
      by the Reichstag. This law would allow Hitler to make laws, control the
      budget and approve treaties. Political enemies were arrested by the
      thousands and put in prisons. This was the beginning of the Nazi
      concentration camps. On March 23, an newly elected Reichstag met to
      consider passing Hitler's bill. If passed it would vote democracy out of
      Germany and establish the legal dictatorship of Adolf Hitler.&nbsp; Hitler
      made a speech to the public making false promises for votes.&nbsp; The
      vote was taken and Hitler had won.&nbsp; That was the end of the German
      Democratic Republic.&nbsp; Under Hitler dictatorship one existed to serve
      the state and obey the Fuhrer.&nbsp; Those who didn't were disposed
      of.&nbsp; Many agreed with Hitler, but many disagreed and left the
      country.&nbsp; In Germany now, there were constant, rallies and military parades.&nbsp; The swastika was present every where.&nbsp; Now that
      Hitler was in control he turned his attention to the hatred of the Jews. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      assembled his cabinet and had them initialize a decree stating Hitler was
      to take command over the entire armed forces.&nbsp; Hitler hired and fired
      generals as he pleased.&nbsp; The&nbsp; German Armed forces were now in
      the hands of an amateur, self-taught strategist.&nbsp; Hitler's troops
      fought for many years with some success, but in the end he could not
      complete his mission to take over the world.&nbsp; On April 30, 1945,
