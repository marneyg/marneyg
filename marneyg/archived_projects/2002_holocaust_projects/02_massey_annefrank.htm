       On May 12, 1899 a man named Otto Frank was born in Frankfurt am Main
       Germany. One year later on January 16th a woman named&nbsp; Edith
       Hollander was born in Achaean Germany. As they grew older Otto served in
       the German Army as a lieutenant along with Adolf Hitler. On May 12, 1925
       these Jewish-German citizens married. On February 16th one year later
       they had a daughter. Her name was Margot Frank. Three years later a very
       special girl was born. Her name was Annelise Marie Frank. We know her as
       Anne.</b></font>

        In 1933 Otto Frank moved to Holland and sent Edith, Margot, and Anne
        to live with Edith's mother until he could pay their way across the
        country. He does this in fear for his family's future, because the
        Anti-Jewish National Socialist Party led by Hitler came to a rise in
        power. On December 5, 1933 Edith and Margot go to Holland. Anne later
        left her grandmother in February of 1934 to be with the rest of her
        family.</b></font></p>

        Meanwhile Hitler's Anti-Jewish act is taking place. Anne and Margot
        were forced to leave their Dutch friends and go to an all-Jewish school.
        On top of all that sadness, Anne's grandmother Hollander died in January
        of 1942.</b></font>

        Six months later on June 12th Anne received a red and white plaid diary
        for her 13th birthday. She wrote in it often and referred to it as
        &quot;Kitty.&quot; She thought that writing in her diary was the only
        time she could discuss her secrets and personal things.</b></font>

        On July 6, 1942 Margot received a call-up notice for a Nazi work
        camp. The very next day Anne and her family went into hiding in the
        &quot;Secret Annex&quot; or &quot;Secret House.&quot; They left false
        notes saying that they had left the country and had gone to Switzerland

        While in hiding the Franks and the rest of the people in the
            house had to be very quiet. Anne thought that it was an ideal hiding
            place though and that there wasn't a better one in all of Holland.
            Anne was also tutored by her father because he wanted her to be
            advanced or caught up when the war was over and she could go back to
        school. Anne and Peter fell in love while they were in hiding.</font></b></td>

        &nbsp;The Franks tried to stay updated on the war and the world
            surrounding them so they had the helpers bring them books or
            newspapers on every Saturday morning. Anne also taped pictures or
            postcards and newspaper clippings on her wall. Anne was a growing
            teenager and I can only imagine how she felt being cooped up in that
            attic for two years. Especially if you were and adventurous girl
            like Anne.</font></b>
        <p><b><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face" size="5" color="#00FFFF">Whatever happiness Anne
          had in the secret annex drained from her on August 4, 1944. Her biggest
          fear came true. Their hiding place was discovered. The eight hiders
          were taken to the police station in Amsterdam. A few days later on
          August 4th everyone was sent to Westerbrook Transit Camp. On September
          3, 1944 they were transported like animals in a cattle car to one of
          the worst death camps, Auschwitz. Sadly Anne and Margot were torn
          apart from their family and were sent to another diseased camp,
        Bergen-Belsen.</font></b>
        <p><b><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face" size="5" color="#00FFFF">
          While in Bergen-Belsen Anne caught the skin disease scabies from
          the filth, disease, and terrible eating conditions. Not too long after
          catching that disease, Anne and Margot, both, caught a far worse
          disease called Typhus. They quickly became ill. Margot dies from this
          disease and after her death Anne gave up her fight to survive and died
          as well.</font></b>
        <p><b><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face" size="5" color="#00FFFF">
          Of all Anne's family her father, Otto, was the only survivor of
          those horrible death camps. He was liberated from Auschwitz by the
          Russian Army. Though he was free from the camp he did not go home. He
          was first taken to Odessa and then to France. After that Otto was
          finally allowed to go home. The war was over at last. Adolf Hitler
          committed suicide on April 30, 1945.</font></b>
        <p><b><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face" size="5" color="#00FFFF">
        Otto Frank heard nothing about his daughters and wife when he came
          home, but he refused to believe that they were dead. He searched for
          them for quite a long time until October 24, 1945 when he received a
          letter saying that they were dead.</font></b>
        <p><b><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face" size="5" color="#00FFFF">
        As for the helpers, Victor Keg and Johannes Kleiman, they were put
          in jail for helping the Jews in the attic. Miep Gies was another
          helper but he was not sentenced to jail. He was only taken to the
          police station and asked a whole lot of questions about hiding the
          Jews but he wasn't caught.</font></b>
        <p><b><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face" size="5" color="#00FFFF">
          When Otto frank went home he received Anne's diary from one of the
        helpers. He had it made into a book. It has been published in 67
        different languages and is one of the most read books worldwide.&nbsp; Anne's father lived a much longer life than her, but on August 19,
        1980 he died in Birsfelden, Switzerland. He was 91 years old.</font></b><p><b><font FACE="Baskerville Old Face" size="5" color="#00FFFF">
          Anne Frank was just one of the millions that were brutally killed in
        the Holocaust, but we remember her the most because of her interesting
        story. She lived the most dreadful life and yet she wrote the most
        intriguing entries. We will remember her for as long as we remember the
        Holocaust.</font></b><p align="center">&nbsp;<p align="center">&nbsp;<p align="center"><img border="0" src="02_franks6_massey.gif" width="317" height="418">
