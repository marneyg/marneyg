      <td width="100%" height="190">It all started on March 16,1911 in Gunzburg Germany, when
        Karl( 1881-1959),and his wife Walburg( ca.-1946 ) Mengele had their first
        son Josef Mengele.&nbsp; Josef also had two younger brothers Karl Jr.(
        1912-1949 ) and Alois ( 1914-1974 ).&nbsp; As Josef was growing up he
        was given the nickname Beppo.&nbsp; When Josef was twenty-six he was
        appointed for research as an assistant at the Third Reich Institution
        for Heredity, Biology , and Ralcial Purity at the University of
        Frankfort.&nbsp; When he was at Frankfort he studied with Professor
        Otmar Freihere von Vershuer.&nbsp; Why he was at Frankfort he took his
        exams and passed with flying colors.&nbsp; When the University of Munich
        saw his scores they transferred him to Munich.&nbsp; In May ( 1938 )
        Josef applied for the SS.&nbsp; He also got married to Irene Sanitats.
        After he got married he was accepted to the SS., and they sent him to
        battle.&nbsp; Why he was in battle he won two Iron Crosses, one was a
        second class medal the other was a first class medal.&nbsp; He also won
        a Black Badge for getting wounded in battle.&nbsp; After being wounded
        in battle he couldn't return, so he was recommended to be a research
        assistant at Auschwitz. As Josef arrived the disease typhus had jut broken
        out. &nbsp; </td>

      <td width="100%" height="171">After he got to Auschwitz he got promoted to caption at
        the unloading docks.&nbsp; Josef used his good looks and his finely tailored
        jacket and pants to get the women to listen to him so he could
        send them to the gas chamber the next second. He also wore all his
        medals, and carried a ridding crop to tap the Jews and tell them were to
        go.&nbsp; He always whistled his favorite Opera tune by Wagner.&nbsp;
        One of the prisoners quoted that:&quot; Josef grabbed her neck, and proceeded
        to beat her head to a bloody pulp.&nbsp; He hit her, slapped her, and
        boxed her. He always hit her in her head--screaming at the top of his
        voice &quot;You want to escape, don't you. You can't escape now.&nbsp;
        You are going to croak you dirty Jew.&quot; As I watched, I saw her two
        beautiful, intelligent eyes disappear under a layer of blood.&nbsp; And
        in a few seconds, her straight, pointed nose was a flat, broken
        mass.&nbsp; Half an hour later, Dr. Mengele returned to the hospital.&nbsp;
        He took out a piece of perfumed soap and, whistling gaily with a smile
        of deep satisfaction began to wash his hands.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

      <td width="100%" height="209">After this he released his duties as selector and went to
        full time doctor.&nbsp; Josef licked twins the best, but he also licked
        Dwarfs, Giants, Gypsies, and other deformed people to do his experiments
        on.&nbsp; he had his own bareax for the people he was going to do his experiments
        on, it was called the Zoo.&nbsp; Josef Mengele had his own office to do
        his experiments in.&nbsp; His experiments were supposes to be trying to
        find out how he can change genetics' in Germans to make a German
        Supper-Race.&nbsp; While Josef was a doctor he was known as the
        &quot;Angel of Death&quot; because of his experiments.&nbsp; He put
        pigments in their eyes to try to change them collars.&nbsp; He also cut
        the chin and pulled out the tong and then the époques with the lungs
        then cut the head to pull out the brain.&nbsp; This was all dune with
        the pashent still awake.&nbsp; The only whay to understand a how a Nazi
        doctor came to do their work at Auschwitz is the psychological punaple I
        call &quot;doubling &quot; the division of the self into two functions
        wholes, so that a part-self acts as an entire self.&nbsp; An Auschwitz doctor
        could, through doubling, not only kill but also organizing silently, on
        behalf of that evil project.&quot;&nbsp; We believe on February 7, 1979
        Mengele had a stroke while swimming in the ocean.&nbsp; And his grave
        stone it says &quot;Wolfgang
        Ganghard.&quot;&nbsp;
