        Theresienstadt was
        established on Nov. 24, 1941 near Prague, Czechoslovakia. The Nazis used
        it as a model ghetto for propaganda purposes. The Nazis also created
        Theresienstadt to fool the outside world into believing that they were
        treating the Jews well. But soon the camp was one of the worst in
        Europe.&nbsp; Of the 140,000 Jews who were sent to Theresienstadt, over
        33,000 died there, 88,000 were deported then killed, and about 20,000
        survived.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

        Jakob Edelstein,
        who was a member of the Czech-Jewish community, believed that it would
        be better for his community to be concentrated locally rather than sent
        to the East. Edelstein hoped that the ghetto would be in a section of
        Prague, but the Nazis chose the town of Terezin.&nbsp; Terezin is
        located about ninety miles north of Prague and just south of Litomerice.
        Terezin consisted of The Big Fortress and The Small Fortress. The Big
        Fortress was surrounded by ramparts and contained barracks. The Small
        Fortress was used as a prison for dangerous criminals. Terezin changed
        when the Nazis renamed it Theresienstadt and sent the first Jewish
        transports there in 1941.</font>

        The Nazis sent
        about 1,300 Jewish men on two transports to Theresienstadt on Nov. 24
        and Dec. 4, 1941. These workers, made up of the Aufbaukommando
        (construction detail), later known as the AK1 and AK2 in the camp. These
        men were sent to work on the garrison town. The largest problem they
        faced was changing a town that needed to hold about 35,000 to 60,000
        people. The camp lacked housing, bathrooms, water, and electricity. To
        solve these problems, the Nazis selected Jakob Edelstein Elder of the
        Jews, or Judenalteste. They also made a Juderant, or a Jewish council.</font>

        What many people
        didn't know that within this calm facade lay a concentration camp.&nbsp;
        With nearly 60 thousand Jews in an area that was supposed to hold 7
        thousand.&nbsp; It had extremely close quarters, a lot of disease, and
        lack of food were also serious concerns.&nbsp; Some people like Norbert
        Troller had enough information in advance to know how to hide his
        valuables.&nbsp; Others, especially the elderly, were fooled but the
        Nazis.&nbsp; They believed that they were going to a resort or
        spa.&nbsp; Some of the elderly actually paid large sums of money for a
        decent location within their new home.&nbsp; When they arrived, they
        were housed in the same places where the other people were. To get to
        Theresienstadt, thousands of Jews, from Orthodox to Assimilated, were
        deported from their old homes.&nbsp; At first, many people going to
        Theresienstadt were Czech, but later German, Austrian, and Dutch Jews
        arrived in the camp.&nbsp; These Jews were crammed into cattle cars with
        little or no food, water, and sanitation.

        The trains were
        unloaded at Buhsovice, the nearest station to Theresienstadt.&nbsp; It
        was about 2 km away.&nbsp; the Jews were then forced to walk the rest of
        the way, carrying all of their luggage.&nbsp; Once the Jews reached
        Theresienstadt, they went to a checking point (called a flood gate or
        Schleuse in camp slang).&nbsp; The Jews then had their personal
        information written down and put in an index.&nbsp; Then, they were
        searched.&nbsp; Mostly, the Nazis and Czech gendarmes were looking for
        jewelry, money, cigarettes, as well as items not allowed in the camp
        such as hot plates and cosmetics.&nbsp; During the initial process, the
        Jews were assigned to their housing.</font>

        thousands of people into a small space has to do with housing.&nbsp;
        Triple-tired bunk beds were made and every available floor space was
        used.&nbsp; The living/sleeping areas were covered with vermin.&nbsp;
        These pests included rats, fleas, flies, and lice.&nbsp; Another problem
        was food.&nbsp; In the beginning, there weren't enough cauldrons to cook
        food for all of the people.&nbsp; In 1942, the inhabitants who worked at
        hard labor received the most food.&nbsp; Usually the elderly received
        the least food and it affected them the most.&nbsp; Lack of nourishment,
        medicines, and general susceptibility to illness made their fatality
        rate extremely high.</font>

        medicines, and space made the bodies outgrow the possible locations for
        graves.&nbsp; In Sept. 1942, a crematorium was built.&nbsp; The
        crematorium could dispose up to 190 bodies a day.&nbsp; Once the ashes
        were searched for gold, usually from gold teeth, they were put in a
        cardboard box and stored.&nbsp; Near the end or the war, the Nazis tried
        to cover their tracks by disposing of the ashes.&nbsp; They dumped 8,000
        boxes into a pit and 17,000 boxes into the Ohre River.</font></p>
