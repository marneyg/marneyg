        as equipped as I am to bring the Germans to the position of supremacy
        which all German statesmen have felt the deserved but were unable to
        achieve.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I carry out the commands that Providence has
        laid upon me.&nbsp; But if the voice speaks then I know the time has
        come to act.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Of secondary importance is the training
        of mental abilities.&nbsp; Over-educated people, stuffed with knowledge
        and intellect, but bare of any sound instincts.&nbsp; These impudent
        rascals who always know everything better than anybody else.&nbsp; The
        intellect has grown autocratic and has become a disease of
        life.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Do you realize you are in the presence of the
        greatest German of all time.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I cannot be
        mistaken.&nbsp; What I do and say is historical.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;For
        the last twenty-four hours I was the supreme court of the
        Germans.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I am one of the hardest men Germany has had
        for decades, perhaps for centuries equipped with the greatest authority
        of any German Leader...but above all, I believe in my success. I believe
        in it unconditionally.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I shall never make such a
        mistake I know how to keep my hold on people after I have passed
        on.&nbsp; I shall be the Fuhrer they look up at and go home to talk of
        and remember.&nbsp; My life shall not end in the mere form of
