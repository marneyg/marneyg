          was in Poland was because if Auschwitz was revealed, they might blame
          it on the Polish Government.&nbsp; Auschwitz had three main camps,
          Auschwitz I, Birkenau, and Monowitz.&nbsp; Auschwitz I was where the
          Nazis met.&nbsp; Birkenau was the was the extermination center and the
          biggest of the three.&nbsp; Monowitz was just a heavy labor
          camp.&nbsp; All were a place where prisoners could be shot, starved,
          attacked by dogs, gassed, or committed suicide</font>

        arrived at Auschwitz in boxcars or cattle cars on a train with no air
        holes. They had no toilets, heat, cooling system, lights, food, water,
        and no medical attention.&nbsp; Prisoners had to relieve
        themselves in the four corners in a boxcar. In the early years, the
        trains would stop at special station's where they could use the
        restrooms and buy food and water at unfair prices. As the years went on
        the rumors spread that the prisoners were being transferred to a death
        camp and many took advantage of the situation and tried to stay at the
        station, or escape. For this reason the policies were changed and the
        prisoners were not allowed to leave the boxcars until they arrived at
        Auschwitz. The Nazis wanted to make the prisoners feel uncomfortable as
        possible.</font></p>

        by shouting men with guns. Prisoners were then put into two lines. Women
        and children on one side and men on the other. Prisoners were selected
        by a Nazi doctor. The most common doctor around was Dr. Josef Mengle.
        The doctors would make a real quick examination and decide who would
        live and work, or who would be sent to the gas chambers. Women that were
        pregnant and little children were sent to the gas chamber. For whatever
        reason those who were picked where forced to die.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Those who were selected to work were led away and taken to a place
        where they were sprayed with disinfectant. The disinfectant stung, but
        it killed the lice which spread disease which was common in Auschwitz.
        After that the clothes and other treasures were taken away to Kanada
        Camp where they stored. The prisoners were assigned a uniform. When the
        camps were overcrowd the prisoners received a uniform used a person who
        had just died. After that you were taken to the main gate which had a

        considered food, such as: bark, garbage, peelings from food, rats, bugs,
        dog biscuits, dirt, and grass. Auschwitz provided some food, but the
        prisoners only got 1,700 calories per day which would be equal to eating
        three candy bars a day under extreme labor. This is a sample menu of the
        food in which might have been given:.</font></p>

        life span was half that amount. There was little food and the food was
        not nutritional. There was hardly any places to wash and no place for
        them to brush there teeth. One survivor had seven teeth pulled because
        he hadn't been allowed to brush his teeth for six years. Lice was a
        constant problem due to infected blankets and other prisoners.</font></p>

        given lethal injections and died. Chronic malnutrition and lack of
        hygiene were the main causes of illnesses.</font></p>

        started at 03:00 a.m. by sounds of shouts and whistles. They had little
        time to rinse there uniforms which were covered with lice. Roll call
        lasted three to ten hours. Prisoners stood around while numbers were
        called out. Anyone who feel or stepped out of line was shot. Following
        roll call it was time for breakfast.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The labor was sometimes useless, for instance hauling huge blocks
        back and forth. Some jobs were better because the prisoner got extra
        food like if you were a tailor and a guard liked his new coat they could
        give you food.&nbsp; Same with being a barber, but the most prized job
        of all was being a cook.&nbsp; Very rarely did prisoners get that job,
        it was usually given to a prisoner if the cook was sick and needed
        someone on short notice. Being the cook meant you could be around food and
        eat it but you could only eat what you thought the guards would miss or
        you were shot.&nbsp; Some jobs were a living nightmare like the
        Sonderkommandos whose job it was to go through the bodies that had been
        just gassed and look for items of some value and take them.&nbsp;
        Uniforms,&nbsp; rings that were hidden during selections, pictures, and
        gold.&nbsp; Then they had to take the bodies to the Crematoriums where
        they had to burn them. Imagine throwing your girlfriend or other loved
        ones in the fire.&nbsp; After a several&nbsp; months of being a

      <p align="left"><font size="4">Out of the thousands of&nbsp; people who died at
      Auschwitz, only 600 chose to risk their, but 400 were caught again.&nbsp;
      The most famous escape was when a man and woman who were in charge of the
      SS (guard) laundry stole a SS uniform.&nbsp; The man (who had the uniform
      on) said he was taking the woman out to be shot and walked right out of
      Auschwitz unharmed.&nbsp; They were caught a few months later and
      sentenced death by hanging.&nbsp; At the execution as the sentence was
      read the man jumped off his stool at will but was put back on the stool
      and was hung the proper way.&nbsp; The woman was hanged later without
      trouble.&nbsp; Escapes were rare because Auschwitz had an electrified
      fence charged at 6000 volts and it only takes 150 volts to kill the
      average human.&nbsp; Along the electrified fence were 28 watchtowers with
      machineguns that kept watch of the prisoners daily.&nbsp; The highest
      death toll of guards in one escape in Auschwitz occurred in Birkenau on
      October 7 1944.&nbsp; During roll call some guards suspected some
      prisoners hiding in Crematorium IV.&nbsp; They were right, but it cost
      them their lives.&nbsp; The prisoners were armed with axes and killed the
      guards.&nbsp; Some prisoners took advantage of the time and started
      throwing stones.&nbsp; Others charged and took the guns and started using
      them, and others ran for the gates and broke free but most were shot from
      the watchtowers.&nbsp; Back at Birkenau wounded guards were torn apart by
      the prisoners.&nbsp; By the time the SS got the revolt under control 12
      German guards were dead.&nbsp; Once prisoners were found they were
      tortured for some amount of days.&nbsp; Then a sign with the word hurrah
      (I'm back) was put on his or her back and was paraded around the camp then
      hung.</font>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

        Death<p>&nbsp; </font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="4">At Auschwitz, the most
        common thing was death. An estimated five to six thousand people died
        daily and on some days the dead out numbered the living. Auschwitz had a
        number of ways to kill. There were gassings, shootings, burnings,
        starvation, brutal labor, lethal injection, hanging, and experiments. In
        the early years of Auschwitz, prisoners would dig trenches and then when
        they were finished, the guards would take the prisoners and shoot them
        so that they would fall into the holes, and then cover the trenches with
        dirt. This soon stopped, because when it would rain the ground would
        erode and the bodies could be seen and a black ooze would come out seep
        into ponds or drinking water. Another problem was that ammunition was
        getting scarce. The Auschwitz camp commandor, Rudolf Hess had heard of
        gassings down at Chlemno, but didn't like the idea of using exhaust from
        tank motors. They later decided to use Zyclon B which are little bluish
        green crystals<img border="0" src="Zyclon2.gif" width="154" height="102"> that release a deadly Prussic acid or cyanide gas when
        exposed to air. The gas chambers were made underground, right next to
        the Crematoriums.&nbsp; They could hold 200 or more<img border="0" src="gas.gif" width="240" height="180">
        prisoners at a time and
        sometimes the chambers were so crowded<img border="0" src="ashes.gif" width="240" height="180">
        that when the people died they
        were still standing. When prisoners were going to be gassed the Germans
        told them they were going to take baths because they didn't want the
        idea of mass killings to spread through the camp. If the gas chambers
        were operating, they would send people to the Crematoriums to be burnt
        alive. Five thousand bodies could be burned in Crematoriums II and III a
        day and three thousand could be burned in IV and V. In August, 1941
        lethal injection began, 30-60 people could die a day. Doctors would say
        they were antidotes. Once the shoot was given the victim would have a
        seizer and then would die. Before the liberation, the Germans rounded up
        prisoners that were strong enough to walk and go for a march. The sick
        were left to die. These marches were called &quot;Death Marches&quot;.
        The Prisoners would be forced to jog or walk for miles. If they would
        slow down or just stop, they were shot. Sometimes there would be no
        survivors. No one really knows how many people died on the Death
        Marches, but like all the other death tolls, it was high. An estimated
        guess of four million people died at Auschwitz and there were supposedly
        six to eight million who died in the Holocaust, which means about half
        of the deaths occurred at Auschwitz.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="4"><img border="0" src="death.gif" width="148" height="128"></font><p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

          would die of eating too much. Doctors and medical supplies came from
          all over Europe. Although they were saved and fully recovered,
          survivors are still having dreams about Auschwitz or other camps.
          Sometimes they wake up in the middle of the night, thinking that they
          are still there, but one thing is for sure, history must not repeat
          itself. The 1940's Holocaust must never happen again. Auschwitz is now
