        established in March 1942. It was located in eastern Poland in an area
        called Lublin. It got its name from a nearby village called Sobibor. The
        Nazis chose its location because of the general isolation and its
        proximity to a railway. Sobibor was built as part of the Reinhard
        Operation. It was second of three camps built.</font>

        meters high and the camp was nearly surrounded by a minefield. The camp
        was originally built with three sections. In summer 1943 a fourth was
        built. Sobibor was in operation for eighteen months and killed about
        250,000 men, women, and children. About 1000 Jews worked there but only
        about 48 prisoners survived the war.</font>

        barracks for the prisoners and workshops like a tailor, shoemaker,
        carpenter, and mechanic. Lager II was where the new arrivals were
        stripped of their possessions and clothing. It also processed the
        objects taken from the new arrivals. Lager III had the gas chambers and
        pyres for burning the dead bodies. It also contained housing for
        prisoners working in Lager III. Lager IV was built in summer 1943 and
        contained warehouses to store captured ammunition.</font>

        up a prisoner's pant legs and put rats in their pants. Another was when
        they forced thin prisoners to quickly drink vodka and then eat several
        pounds of sausage. After that the SS officers forced their mouths open

        line was for the men and one for the women and children. After that the

        military and leadership experience.&nbsp; On September 23, 1943 Leon's
        person arrived. It was First Lieutenant Alexander &quot;Sasha&quot;
        Pechersky with a few of his men. Sasha was captured October 1941 near

        using Shlomo Leitman to deliver messages to not draw attention to them.&nbsp;
        The first plan was to dig a tunnel
        under the fences and the minefield in the carpentry shop. But that plan
        was ruined on October 8th and 9th due to heavy rain. So the second plan
        was to make knives and hatchets in the workshops. Sasha's men started to
        kill SS men but on the day of the revolt October 13th more SS men
        arrived. The revolt was then postponed till the next day October 14.</font>
