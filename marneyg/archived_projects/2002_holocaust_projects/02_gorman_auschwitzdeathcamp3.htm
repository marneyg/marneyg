        &quot;Krematorium II functioned as a homicidal gas chamber and
        incineration installation from March 15, 1943, before its officially
        coming into service on March 31, to November 27, 1944, annihilating a

        &quot;Krematorium III was used in a similar fashion from June 25, 1943
        to November 27, 1944. killing approximately 350,000 victims.&nbsp;
        Approximately three-quarters of the Jewish victims of KL

        was commissioned by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum to carry out
        Geological tests at Birkenau aimed at determining the locations of
        burning pits and pyres.&nbsp; Specialists of Hydrokop bored 303 holes up
        to 3 meters deep.&nbsp; Traces of human ashes, bones, and hair turned up
        in 42 sites.&nbsp; Documentation of all the holes and diagrams of their

      Crematorium II &quot; The evolution of the Auschwitz concentration camp is
      captured in the hundreds of architectural plans the Germans forgot to
      destroy and the Poles and Soviets preserved the archives in Oswiecim and
      Moscow. A unique historical source, these materials are part of the
      archive of Zentralbauleitung der Waffen SS and Polizei, Auschwitz
      O/S.&nbsp; For while the Germans burned the archives of the camp
      Kommandatur prior to their evacuation from Auschwitz in January 1945, as
      Allied bombs helped them accomplish this same task as SS
      headquarters.&nbsp; In Berlin, the archive of the construction office,
      some three hundred yards away from the Kommandatur, was overlooked and
      remained intact.&nbsp; There is no similarly complete archive from any
      other concentration cam, and none of the administratively less complex
      Operation Reinhard death camps under the control of Odio Globocnik (
      Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka) generated such documents.&quot; ( Dwork Van
