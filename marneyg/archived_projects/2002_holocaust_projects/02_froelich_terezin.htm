        a town located 90 miles

        Empress Maria Teresa.&nbsp; Terezin changed dramatically when the Nazis

        Deportations: 100-500 Jews were deported daily.&nbsp; The burden of who
        was to be deported was placed on the Jews.&nbsp; Some ways that helped
        Jews from being deported were jobs that helped the German war effort,
        important workers in the ghetto, or being on someone else's list.&nbsp;
        Finding ways to keep from being deported to extermination camps became a

        Theresienstadt.&nbsp; These groups were being evacuated from

        Jews hoping not to be convicted of war crimes.&nbsp; Others wanted to
