        Armstrong Custer set out for Montana on a 78 mile journey that took near
        24 hours.&nbsp; Custer, hoping to become president one day, thought that
        by destroying a Sioux and Cheyenne Indian village he could fulfill this
        dream.&nbsp; He and about 600 soldiers arrived on June 25, 1876 at about
        3:00 p.m. (Chicago time) and immediately attacked, but didn't make much
        of an impact on Sitting Bull's 4,000 men.&nbsp; Reno and his men were
        the first to attack.&nbsp; The Indians were caught off guard.</font></b></td>

      This battle, along the Little Bighorn River, took place some nearly 120
      years ago.&nbsp; Today, it's also known as Custer's Last Stand.&nbsp; Many
      believe that the gold rush led to the initial attack.&nbsp; Two days later
      on the 27th Terry went back to rescue the survivors and bury the
      dead.&nbsp; Now stands the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument
      established in 1886.&nbsp; It was previously called Custer's Battlefield
      National Monument until 1991. &nbsp;</font></b>
