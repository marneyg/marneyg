      <td width="100%"><font size="4">Sitting bull was born around 1831 on the
        Grand River at a place the Sioux nation called &quot;Many Catches&quot;,
        for the number of food storage pits they had dug there. As a child he
        was given the name Tatanka-Iyotake, meaning buffalo bull sitting
        intractably on its haunches. He lived up to this name throughout his
        life.</font>
        <p><font size="4">As a young man he became a leader of the Strong Heart
        Warrior Society, he was later a distinguished member of the Silent
        Eaters, a group concerned with tribal warfare.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">He fought his first battle at the age of fourteen in a
        raid at the Crow. In June, 1863 he had his first encounter American
        soldiers. In 1864 he fought U.S. troops again at the Battle of Killdeer
        Mountain. In 1865 he led a siege against fort rice, a fort built on
        Indian land. In 1868 he became the head chief of the Sioux Nation.</font><p><font size="4">After
        his tribe was put on a reservation in the Black Hills, that was supposed
        to be restricted from whites, gold was found in them in 1876. Sitting
        Bull and his warriors tried to fight for their land, but his tribe was
        driven out by miners and prospectors. They settled in the valley of the
        Little Bighorn river.</font><p><font size="4">In June 1876 Custer's
        advanced party of General Alfred H. Terry's, 7th Calvary, attacked
        Sitting Bull's tribe at the valley of the Little Bighorn River. The 7th
        Calvary was out numbered and defeated and massacred by the Sioux
        warriors. They were later pursued northward by General Alfred H. Terry.</font><p><font size="4">After
        that Sitting Bull and part of his band escaped to British territory. In
        1880 he couldn't feed his family and surrendered on promise of pardon.
        On July 19,1881 he was sent to prison as a prisoner of war.</font><p><font size="4">On
        May 10,1883 Sitting Bull rejoined his family and tribe at the Standing
        Rock Reservation. He was however allowed to leave the reservation to
        join Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, where he earned fifty dollars a week
        for riding once around the arena, plus the money he earned for signing
        autographs.</font><p><font size="4">In 1888 he influenced his tribe to
        refuse to relinquish Indian lands. He was later shot and killed on
        December 15,1890 when one of his followers tried to rescue him from
        reservation police. He was buried at Fort Yates in North Dakota, then in
        1953 his remains were moved to Mobridge, South Dakota Where his grave is
        marked with a granite shaft.</font><p><font size="4">We will always
        remember him as a Hunkpapa Lakota chief and a Sioux nation holy
        man.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
