      <td width="100%" colspan="2"><font face="Arial" size="4">Crazy Horse was one of the
        bravest Sioux warriors ever.&nbsp; He was born on the Republican River
        about 1845.&nbsp; He was said to be a rather handsome man.&nbsp; His
        childhood nickname was Curly.&nbsp; Crazy Horse loved horses and when he
        was a very young boy his father gave him a pony.&nbsp; He loved his
        brother dearly and at the age of twelve he saved him from an attacking
        bear.&nbsp; If that doesn't show you his bravery he also killed a
        buffalo at the age of twelve. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">At the age of sixteen he inherited his
        fathers name Crazy Horse and led a charge against the Gros Ventres.&nbsp;
        He was a natural leader of his people especially in time of war.&nbsp;
        His best friend was probably Hump.&nbsp; People called them &quot;the
        grizzly and the bear&quot; because Hump was much older than him.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">Crazy Horse's greatest fight would
        probably have to be the Battle of Little Bighorn.&nbsp; In June 1876 all
        Sioux Indian tribes came together.&nbsp; The camp stretched for about
        three miles.&nbsp; On June 17 scouts reported that their was an advance
        being made by a large body of troops under General Crook.&nbsp; The war
        party went in the night so that the enemy could not see them.&nbsp;
        Within three or four miles from camp they came unexpectedly upon some of
        General Crooks Crow scouts.&nbsp; They fired shots and the crows fled
        back to Crooks camp but were pursued by the Sioux by the Sioux.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">The soldiers were warned by the shots
        fired at the Crows and it was impossible for Crazy Horses war party to
        enter the well-protected camp.&nbsp; Again and again Crazy Horse
        attacked the camp but could not get the troops in the open.&nbsp; The
        attack lasted for a very long time and toward the afternoon he finally
        withdrew and returned to camp.&nbsp; The Indians now crossed the divide
        between the Tongue and the Little Bighorn where they felt safe.&nbsp;
        Later that same day Custer tried to attack the tribe at the river
        bottom.&nbsp; But Crazy Horse was ready and outsmarted Custer and took
        his life.&nbsp; That turned out to be Crazy Horses greatest victory.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="4">After the battle Sitting Bull fled to 
        Canada.&nbsp; Crazy Horse and his people wondered about undisturbed for 
        the rest of the year because many people were afraid to attack him.&nbsp; 
        On May 5, 1877 after a long winter and his people starving,&nbsp; Crazy 
        Horse led 800 followers to Fort Robinson and surrendered.&nbsp; They 
        were promised a reservation but that turned out to be a lie.&nbsp; On 
        September 5, 1877 he was taken to Fort Robinson and not knowing he was 
        going to be put in jail, he tried to resist it and was bayoneted by a 
        soldier.&nbsp; He died later that evening at the age of 33.</font></p>
