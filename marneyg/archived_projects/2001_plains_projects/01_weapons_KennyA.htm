        Some early weapons were made form stones but man kind has learned from
        then. That is why I made this it so you can learn about some weapons
        that we have used in the past. all the weapons I tell about can be dated
        back to late 1800's.</font></td>

        they also used the 1873 spring field carbine model and also their
        swords. but we shouldn't forget about the Hotchkiss gun ,the trapdoor Springfield
        ,the muzzle loader, or the ward Burton bolt action rifle. Plus all these
        weapons were used during the battle of little big horn. (here are some

        One reason the 7th cavalry had single shot systems was cause of the ordnance
        department decided to use single shot systems. Cause they said
        &quot;that the gun is as good as the man that uses it&quot; and with the
        proper training a solider could fire 12-15 shots in one min.</font></td>

        But guns weren't the only weapons of the time. The bow and arrows were a
        deadly combo. They could leave wounds that left blood and other fluids
        gushing from your body. If not treated you could die from bleeding to
        death. So the army needed physicians to treat the wounded but many men
        were hard to come by. Not many people wanted to join as a physician
        cause they didn't want to die or cause of their other fears.</font></td>

        Still during the wars the one advantage to the army cause Indians had
        guns too was their range. But most Indians had short ranged weapons (the
        rang was about 300yards few went higher than 500yards).Most of the
        army's weapons had the same range. But they had more of them that went
        over 6oo yards than the Indians did. so they had the advantage of
        staying protected while they shot sometimes. Before the battle of little
        big horn one officer of Custer suggested that the should equip new
        weapons for the battle but Custer told him &quot;equipping new weapons
        to his cavalry would not change the battle&quot;. But all the weapons
        still had the same overall performance .</font></td>

        But it was not till the 1980's that we discovered that Indians </font><font size="4">used
        gun powered weapons. this tells us that Indians had a more than bow and
        arrows this means that they could adapt to learn how to survive. but Indians
        had less ammo then the army so the Indians had to use it carefully or
        they would surly lose the battle. Some of different types of weapons
        that the Indians carried were muzzlers, Springfield carbine, or bows and
        arrows. d at little big horn was 2361 cartridges, bullets, and shells
        that came from only 45 different weapons.</font></td>

        Because Indians had guns and better tactics they were able to defeat Custer.
        one reason the army was bad was that 200-1000 men would stand blasting their
        guns at the Indians and hit few of them. At the southern end of little
        big horn is proof cause out of 5000 shots only two Indians were hit. But
        with all that fire power 42000 rounds of ammo were used or lost and for
        ever 840 shot only two Indians were hit at little big horn. </font></td>
