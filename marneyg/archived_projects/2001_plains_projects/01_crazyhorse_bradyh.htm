        Horse was born on 1842?- 1877. He may have been 35 years old. He did not
        allow any photos taken of him, because he believed it would take his
        spirit. He was born on the Republican River. They gave him the name
        Tashunkewitko; Most remembered by Crazy Horse. All he wanted was the
        best way for the Sioux. </font></td>

        warrior, Chief Joseph was not. One of the most remarkable things about
        him was he pictured his death. He always fought fierce for the Lakota
        way of life. Even when he was 13, he stole horses from the crow and
        before he was 20 he led war parties.&nbsp; </font></td>

        buffalo hunts with his father. One time when he stayed with the other
        boys, they told him to ride a wild buffalo calf. So he lassoed it and
        got on. It took him across the country, but he never fell off. When he
        got off they asked him how he was. Tired he replied.&nbsp; </font></td>

        them. Crazy Horse pushed his brother up the berry tree, went climbed on
        his horse, got his tomahawk and ran at the bear yelling. The bear seen
        the boys power and took off in the other direction. Even then people

        Crazy Horse' father went on a hunt and brought back two antelopes. Crazy
        Horse, before his parents could notice, was telling everyone to go to
        his teepee to get food. There was a line of&nbsp; indians and when
        everyone was done there was only enough food for two meals for Crazy
        Horse and his family. As the indians left, they were praising Crazy Horse. The
        next day Crazy Horse asked his mother for food and she said,
        &quot;Remember, my son, they went home singing praises in your name not
        my name or your fathers. You must be brave. You must live up to your
        reputation.&quot; And he did.</font></td>

        became good friends and fought and won a lot of battles. People would

        Horse fought in the 1865-1868 wars led by Red Cloud. In 1876 he became
        the leader of resistance. He went after General George Crook. Allied to
        the Cheyenne through marriage to a Cheyenne woman, Crazy Horse got 1,200
        Ogallala and Cheyenne warriors. Crook went up the Rosebud Creek toward
        Sitting Bulls camp on the Little Bighorn. The camp stretched 3-4 miles.
        After that victory on June 17, 1876 Crazy Horse joined forces with
        Sitting Bull. On June 25 1876, he led a band of warriors and wiped out
        General Custer and his 7th Calvary. Known as Custer's Last Stand. The
        Americans tried to flee South and West. Chief Gall and Hunkpapa charged

        loss of buffalo, Crazy Horse had to surrender on May 6, 1876 at Fort
        Robinson, Nebraska. He was one of the last chiefs to surrender. Crazy
        Horse received assurances that he and his followers would be permitted to
        settle in the Powder River Country in Montana. Crazy Horse arrived with
        a band of 800 warriors, all of them had weapons and singing songs of
        war. In the late summer a rumor said Crazy Horse was planning a battle,
        so on September 5 he was brought back to Fort Robinson.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
