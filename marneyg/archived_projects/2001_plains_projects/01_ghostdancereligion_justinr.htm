        ghost dance religion is a religion that Indians believed would restore
        the earth to the way it was before the white men arrived. They thought
        it would bring back loved ones both human and animal and it would bring
        back all their buffalo. They believed it would restore their&nbsp; land
        back to them. They thought the earth would be covered with a new soil
        burying all white men. It would be covered with sweet grass, running
        water, and trees. They believed that all the Indians who danced this
        religion would be taken up into the air and be suspended there while the
        new earth was being laid down. Sitting Bull, a fierce warrior, however
        did not believe it would bring people back from the dead.</font><p><img border="0" src="01_gdpic1_jens.jpg" width="250" height="164">&nbsp;</td>

        Bull for it.&nbsp; </font></td>

      <td height="22" width="745" colspan="2"><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">&quot;The
        coming of the troops has frightened the Indians. If the Seventh Day Adventists
        prepare the ascension robes for the second coming of the
        savior, the United States Army is not put in motion to prevent them. Why
        should not the Indians have the same privilege? If the troops remain,
        trouble is sure to come.&quot; said former agent Valentine McGillycuddy.
        Nonetheless on December 12 an order was put out for Sitting Bull to be
        arrested. Sitting Bull said this about being arrested &quot;Let the
        soldiers come and take me away and kill me, Wherever they like. I am not
        afraid. I was born a warrior. I have followed the warpath ever since I
        was able to draw a bow.&quot; Three days later on December 15 Forty
        three Indian policemen surrounded Sitting Bull's cabin. Three miles back
        there was another squadron to backup the policemen. When Lieutenant Bull
        Head entered the cabin Sitting Bull was still asleep. Sitting Bull
        agreed to come out with the police. He asked that his horse be saddled
        while he dressed. After they left the cabin a large group of ghost
        dancers, much larger than the police force, had assembled&nbsp; and
        challenged the police. A war broke out and Catch-the-Bear, a ghost
        dancer, shot Lt. Bull Head with a rifle. In attempt to fire back Lt.
        Bull Head accidentally shot Sitting Bull then Red Tomahawk ,a policeman,
        shot Sitting Bull in the head. After the war had broke out most of
        Sitting Bull's tribe surrendered others fled south towards the badlands
        to join Big Foot And his tribe. He had been leading the ghost dancers on
        the Cheyenne River Reservation. 106 warriors and about 250 women and
        children and the persuaded chief, who was grievously ill with pneumonia,
        fled to the Pine Ridge Reservation to join Red Cloud.&nbsp;On December
        28 the army intercepted them and brought them to the location on Wounded
        Knee Creek to be disarmed. Black Coyote, a deaf young warrior, raised a
        gun above his head when they were trying to take it away it went off.
        When other Indians heard it they threw there blankets aside and opened
        fire against the army. The government fired into the ranks of native
        warriors. Big Foot was among one of the first casualties. 300 Indians and 31 soldiers died here and 300
        Indians and 25 soldiers were&nbsp;
        killed near Sitting Bull's cabin. This war ended all Indian wars between
        the Indians and the government.&nbsp;</font><p>&nbsp;</td>
