        Elizabeth Custer's home
        town was Monroe Michigan. She was engaged when General George Armstrong
        Custer came home that autumn to recover from a flesh wound. Libby got
        married to Custer in February of 1864.&nbsp; During Libby and Custer's
        honey moon Libby was left behind in Washington. A few hours later she
        found herself on the extreme wing of the Potomac, in a insolated
        Virginia farm-house, finishing her honeymoon alone.</b></font>
        <p><font color="#800000" size="4"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The General's old colored servant,
        Eliza comforted Libby, and the southern family in the house took pity
        upon Libby's anxiety. It is a sudden plunge into a life of danger, and
        Libby could hardly remember the time during the twelve years that
        followed when she was not in fear of some immediate peril, or in dread
        of some danger that threatened her. After the raid was over, Libby and
        Custer spent some weeks together and when the regular spring campaign
        began, Libby returned to Washington, where she remained until the
        surrender and the close of war.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#800000" size="4"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After living in Washington, Libby
        went to Texas for a year while Custer was still acting as Major-General
        in command of volunteers. In 1866 Libby and Custer returned to Michigan
        and the autumn of the same year found their selves in Kansas, where the
        General assumed charge of the 7th Cavalry, to which Custer had been
        assigned, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the Regular Army. They
        remained in Kansas for five years. The Custer's left Kansas when the 7th
        Cavalry was reassigned in 1871. Libby and Custer were then ordered, with
        the regiment, to Kentucky. They stayed in Elizabethtown for two years.
        Their wish to return to the plains was granted in 1873 when the received
        orders to report to Fort Lincoln in the Dakota Territory.</b></font></p>

        Bighorn River in May 1876. General George Armstrong Custer and five

        lectures, magazine articles and books. Shy was lobbying Congress for a
