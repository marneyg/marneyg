        Ohio.&nbsp; His parents were Emanuel and Maria Custer.&nbsp; George had
        three brothers and one sister.&nbsp; Custer had many nicknames.&nbsp; To
        his family members he was known as &quot;Autie&quot; because of his
        first attempts to say Armstrong.&nbsp; To the Indians he was known as
        &quot;Longhair&quot;.&nbsp; Many of the officers in the army called him
        &quot;Boy General&quot;.</font></td>

        Custer was known as &quot;Boy General&quot; because he was the youngest
        man ever to become a general.&nbsp; George went to West Point
        Academy.&nbsp; Custer's lifestyle had to change because he almost got
        kicked out of the Academy but someone secretly changed the demerits so
        he would have less.&nbsp; Autie graduated at the bottom of his class in
        1861.&nbsp; Custer reported for duty in Washington.&nbsp; After General
        McClellan's retirement, Custer was returned to his regiment as
        lieutenant.&nbsp; He was appointed to general of volunteers.&nbsp; After
        that he was a captain then on to Lieutenant Colonel, and lastly at age
        23 he became a general.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Custer married
        Elizabeth Bacon in February of 1864.</font></td>

        After rounding them up Custer left Fort Hayes to see his wife.&nbsp; The
        United States Supreme Court found General Custer guilty of desertion and
        suspended him for a year from the army.</font></td>

        The Battle of Little Big Horn, also known as Custer's Last Stand, took
        place on June 25th, 1876, in the Montana
        Territory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Custer left the Rosebud River on June 22nd with two companies of the 7th
        Cavalry.&nbsp; When Gen. Custer came upon Sitting Bull's camp he
        estimated that there were 1000 Indian Warriors but in fact there were
        4000.&nbsp; Custer divided his regiment into three groups.&nbsp; Captain
        Frederick Benteen was assigned to the south of the camp with 125
        soldiers.&nbsp; Major Marcus Reno was to go across the Little Big Horn
        with 115 soldiers.&nbsp; Custer had 264 soldiers and he headed east of
        the Little Bighorn.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFF00" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Outnumbered ten to one Custer attacked.&nbsp; The long, bloody battle
        resulted in Custer's entire cavalry being wiped out including Custer's
        brother who was serving with him.&nbsp; The army lost 507 men that
        day.&nbsp; Surprisingly Custer's body was not mutilated like the rest of
        them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indian chiefs, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse and Gall
        decided to let the Indian women do what they wanted to him.&nbsp; He
        ended up with holes in his ears so that in the after life he could hear
        the Indian women and what they told him.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFF00" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Because Reno was held up on a hill the whole day, many blame him for the
        losses and for not helping Custer and Benteen and their cavalries.&nbsp;
        General Gibbon's cavalry didn't come to Reno's aid until the battle was
        over so they couldn't do anything.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFF00" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        After the battle Generals William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan said that
        General Custer was &quot; Rashly imprudent to attack such a large number
        of Indians&quot; referring to Sitting Bull's force of 4000.&nbsp; The remaining Indians were put in jail as
        Prisoners of War.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFF00" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Custer was buried at West Point on October 10, 1877.&nbsp; He was only
        37 when he died in the Battle of Little Bighorn.&nbsp; A statue of
        General George Custer was erected in 1879, but wife Libby didn't think
        it looked like him, so she made them take it down.&nbsp; The whereabouts
        of it are still unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
