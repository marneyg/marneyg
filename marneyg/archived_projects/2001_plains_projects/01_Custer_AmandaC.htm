        Custer thought it was a retreat but they weren't. Custer thought
        it&nbsp; would be best to attack immediately. in that thought he slit
        his regiment into three main groups. One under Captain Fredrick W.
        Benteen, one under Major Marcus A. Reno, and one under himself.&nbsp; He
        sent Benteen south to prevent any Indians from escaping in that
        direction.&nbsp; Then he ordered Reno to cross the river and attack the
        village.&nbsp; Custer along with his brothers, brother-in-law, and his
        nephew went north trying to find the end of the village or just a weak
        point.&nbsp; Instead he went to the middle of the 6 mile long village.
        They were outnumbered 10-1.&nbsp; Reno and his badly hurt regiment
        retreated up the other side of the river on a hill.&nbsp; There he and
        his regiment were met by Benteen waited there for Custer.&nbsp;
        meanwhile 4 miles away the Indians had surrounded Custer and his men and
        killed them.&nbsp; Next to Custer his brother-in-law died.&nbsp; Benteen
