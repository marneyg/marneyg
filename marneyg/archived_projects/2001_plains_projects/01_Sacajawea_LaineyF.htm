        kidnapped by the Hidatsa tribe.&nbsp; They then sold her as a slave to
        the Mandan Sioux.&nbsp; Sacagawea and another girl were purchased by a
        French Canadian Trapper, Toussaint Charbonneau.&nbsp; Sacagawea and
        Charbonneau were married.&nbsp; Sacagawea then became pregnant with

        son named Jean Baptist Charbonneau.&nbsp; Jean Baptist was more often
        called &quot;Pomp&quot; or &quot;Pompy.&quot;&nbsp; When Sacagawea first
        met Lewis and Clark this is what she told the reporter, &quot;I knew
        that first day...when I first saw Lewis and Clark...that I would die at

        of the Americas</font><font face="Garamond">, who &quot;caught and saved
        many of the valuable supplies and surveying instruments as they washed overboard.&quot;
        Or as a different reporter wrote it, &quot;She sat calmly in the stern
        and rescued most of the equipment as it floated past on the foaming
        water.&nbsp; Then, the frail Indian girl only 110 pounds...dove into the
        water and brought up the few remaining pieces of vital equipment and
        instruments.&nbsp; Sacagawea's legendary strength, wisdom and love for
        the white leaders was beginning to unfold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Sacagawea became sick in the spring of 1805.&nbsp; Lewis expressed
        concern for her in his journal.&nbsp; He was also concerned about the
        expedition, since she was &quot;our only dependence for a friendly
        negotiation with the Snake [Shoshone] Indians on whom we depend for

        Sacagawea assured Lewis and Clark that the Shoshones, were somewhere

        August, but the Indian bolted when the captain tried to say something in
        Shoshone that Sacagawea had been teaching him.&nbsp; A day later they
        came across three terrified Shoshone woman who eventually led them
        toward the Shoshone camp after Lewis gave them trinkets and calmed them
        down.&nbsp; According to Lewis &quot;bothe parties now advanced and we
