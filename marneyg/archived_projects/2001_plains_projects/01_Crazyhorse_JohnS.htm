      <td width="70%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crazy Horse was born along
        Rapid Creek. His dad was&nbsp; the Oglala medicine man of the same
        name and his Brule wife, which was the sister of Spotted Tail. His
        mother died when he was young, and his father&nbsp; took her sister as a
        wife. When Crazy Horse was a child he was
        called Curly. Before he was 12, Curly had killed a buffalo and had
        received his very own horse.
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he was away from camp during
        the Battle of Ash Hollow, he witnessed the destruction of the Sioux
        tepees and possessions by the soldiers during the Gen. William S.
        Harney's&nbsp;punitive expedition through Sioux&nbsp;
        territory along the Oregon Trail, experience that helped shape his militant
        attitude towards the whites.</td>

    <tr>
      <td width="100%" colspan="2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After the Grattan Fight, were the Brule leader was killed, Curly had
        a vision guest in which he had a vivid dream of a rider in a storm on
        horseback, he had long unbraided hair, a small stone in has ear, zigzag
        lighting decorating his cheek, and also a hail-dotted body. AL though a
        warrior, he bore no scalps. People clutched at the rider , but couldn't
        hold him. The storm faded and a red-backed hawk flew over the riders head. When
        he later related the dream to his father, the medicine man interpreted
        it as a sign of his sons future greatness in battles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about the age of 16, bearing his fathers name, Crazy Horse rode
        for the very first time as an adult warrior in the Raid on Crows. Just
        like the rider in his dream, he wore his hair free, a stone earring, and
        he had a headdress with a red hawk feather in it. His face painted with
        hail-like dots.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The raid was successful, but Crazy
        Horse had received a wound in the leg, because, his father had
        interpreted , unlike the rider in the vision, he had taken 2 scalps. In
        the remainder of his career as a warrior, it is said he never took a
        scalp again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crazy Horse became known to many Sioux
        bands for his courage in the war for the Bozeman Trail of 1866-68. Near
        Fort Phil Kearny, Wyoming, Crazy Horse was in the Indian victories known
        as the Fetterman Fight of December 21, 1866, and the Wagon Box Fight of
        August 2, 1867. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crazy Horse had become war chief of
        the Oglalas, with some Brule followers as well. He made friends and
        followers among the Northern Cheyenne's though his first marriage was to
        a Cheyenne woman. He later married an Oglala woman too. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Black Hills Gold Rush, bought more
        whites to the religion, which increased tension. When the hunting hands ignored
        the order to report to their reservations by January 31, 1876, the military&nbsp;
        went after them. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indians moved to Bighorn River. On
        June 25, in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Crazy Horse led the
        victory assault against George Armstrong Custer's men from the North and
        West. Gall's warriors attacked from South and West. After Little
        Bighorn, the Indians had split up, Crazy Horse led his people back to
        Rosebud. More and more fugitives were surrendering. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crazy Horse's wife became sick, she
        was dying of Tuberculosis. His daughter which was his only child had
        died recently from the same thing, Tuberculosis. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On hearing unfound rumors that Crazy
        Horse was planning a rebellion, Cook ordered him to be arrested. Crazy
        Horse surrendered. It was thought that Crazy Horse had not expected to
        be imprisoned, but Little Big Man walked arm-in-arm with Crazy Horse,
        and his cousin and friend, Touch-The-Cloud, was just in advance. When
        they passed the Sentinel, an officer approached them and had walked on
        his other side. Unsuspectingly Touch-The-Cloud turned back exclaiming
        &quot;Cousin, they will put you in prison.&quot; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Another white man's trick! Let
        me go! Let me die fighting!&quot; cried Crazy Horse. He stopped and
        tried to free himself and escape but both arms were held fast by Little
        Big Man and the officer. While he struggled, a solider stabbed him with
        his bayonet from behind. Crazy Horse had died that night. His dad sang
        the death song over Crazy Horse. </p>
