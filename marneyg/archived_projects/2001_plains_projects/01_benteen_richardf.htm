        On August 24, 1834 in Petersburg, Virginia, Fredrick William Benteen was
        born. Benteen and his family were from the south but Benteen dreamed of
        being a Union General. Benteen's dream came true, He was part of the
        Union army. He was enlisted in the Tenth Missouri Cavalry as a
        lieutenant. During the Civil War, Benteen moved rapidly through the
        ranks, and took control of several regiments. In 1862 Benteen married
        his longtime girlfriend Kate Norman. Benteen and his wife bought a house
        outside Southern Atlanta. After they settled down, Fredrick went back to
        his regiment in the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      <td width="50%" height="199"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In 1864 Benteen took over the 138th U.S. Colored Volunteers. A copal days
        later Benteen resigned from the 10th Missouri Cavalry. But in 1866 the
        138th USCT disbanded and Fredrick was out of the job. On July 28, 1867
        the Army Act was passed and 30 new regiments, and 4 new cavalries were
        formed. The cavalries were, the 9th and 10th, which were the colored
        units, and the 7th and 8th, which were the white units. Benteen
        September, applied for the Regular Army commission in the 7th or 8th
        cavalry. On November 24, Benteen accepted to be a Captain in the 7th
        cavalry. He was ordered to Fort Riley, Kansas to depart with the new
        assignment with the 7th cavalry. That's when he met the famous George
        Armstrong Custer. When he first saw Custer he knew he would dislike
        him.&nbsp;</font> </td>

        On November 27, 1868, at the Battle of Washita, Benteen's dislike of
        Custer changed to pure hatred. Benteen hated Custer now because troops
        led by Major Elliott had left the 7th cavalry and went looking for a
        band of escaping Indians. At the end of the day Major Elliott had not
        came back. Custer ordered&nbsp;the troops to go back to the supply
        station without looking for Major Elliott. But on December 2, Custer had
        to report to General Sheridan about the Battle of Washita. Custer lied
        to Sheridan about the lost soldiers. After that Benteen barged in and
        told the truth that he didn't make any attempt to find the soldiers. But
        that wouldn't be the last of the arguments.&nbsp;</font>

        At the Battle of Little Big Horn, Benteen and Custer argued over the
        plan to attack the Indians. Custer told the troops to break up in three
        groups and surround the village. Benteen disagreed. He thought that they
        should wait for the other troops coming to relieve the 7th Cavalry.
        Custer didn't listen, He kept on ignoring them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

        On the day of the day of the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer ordered
        the troops to charge the village. Benteen was ordered to charge the
        south fork of the river. That was where Benteen retreated. After the
        retreat, Benteen joined with Major Reno in a plan to survive. The 7th
        Cavalry wasn't destroyed. Reno, Benteen, and about 400 soldiers survived
        the two-day battle at the hill four miles away from the place where
        Custer died.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

        After the Battle of Little Big Horn, Benteen moved to the 9th Cavalry
        were he stayed until his retirement. But in 1879, in Chicago, Benteen
        and Reno were ordered to testify in front of the jury. They presented a
        forged petition and altered maps for the cover-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

        people. The Governor of Georgia, the Mayor of Atlanta, and several other
        important people.</font> </td>
