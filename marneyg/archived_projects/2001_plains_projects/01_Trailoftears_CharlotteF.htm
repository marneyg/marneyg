              <p align="center">In 1838 when the Trail of Tears stared Cherokee
              mothers were grieving and crying because their children were
              dying, and there was nothing they could do.&nbsp; So the elders
              Prayed for a sign to strengthen and lift the mothers
              spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <p align="center"> The next day a beautiful flower began to grow
              wherever the mothers cried.&nbsp; The flower has a golden center
              that represents the gold taken from the Cherokees land.&nbsp;
              White petals that represent the mothers tears.&nbsp; Each flower
              has seven petals representing the seven Cherokee clans. &nbsp;</p>

            <p class="MsoBodyText">When you think of Native Americans, you 
            usually think of the “Hollywood” portrayal of horrible dark skinned 
            people spreading terror throughout the West.&nbsp; This is not true.&nbsp; The 
            Cherokee were not nomadic savages, but a very civilized nation with 
            customs modified after ours.&nbsp; For Example the established churches, 
            schools, roads, their women wore European styled gowns.&nbsp; Many became 
            farmers or ranchers.&nbsp; They had their own representational government 
            and a written language thee “Talking Leaves”.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText">Despite the Cherokees peaceful and well 
            adapted ways.&nbsp; In 1830 the Congress passed the Indian removal act 
            which was authorized by Andrew Jackson (whose life was save in the 
            battle of Horseshoe Bend by 500 Cherokee allies).&nbsp; Also authorized 
            the treaty.&nbsp; After this was passed the Cherokees fought back 
            fiercely and legally in the Supreme Court by establishing themselves
            as an 
            independent nation. </p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText">In the case Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia, the 
            court refused to hear the case claiming the Cherokee did not 
            represent a sovereign nation.&nbsp; In 1832 Reverent Samuel Worcester, the 
            Cherokee Missionary challenged the attempt to take away Cherokee 
            land in Worcester vs. Georgia.&nbsp; The Supreme Court ruled the Cherokee 
            Nation was sovereign and would first have to sign a treaty before 
            being which the Senate would then ratify.&nbsp; Despite the Worcester vs. 
            Georgia case, President Andrew Jackson defied the court and ordered 
            the Cherokees removal using the Treaty of New Echota of 1835 to 
            justify his actions. </p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText">The 100 Cherokee Leaders (the treaty Party) whom 
            illegally signed this treaty also signed their death warrant.&nbsp; They 
            signed in giving away all lands east of the Mississippi in exchange 
            for:&nbsp; land in Indian Territory, money, tools, livestock, and other 
            various provisions, etc. </p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText">In 1838 they began moving the native American 
            west to Oklahoma including a group of Old Cherokees settlers who 
            moved to Arkansas in 1817 and had an established government.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText">After being ordered to move in on the 
            Cherokees, General John Wool handed in his resignation and General 
            Winfield Scott took over. </p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText">Scott arrived at New Echota on May 17, 1838, 
            with 7,000 men and began the invasion.&nbsp; They were moved into prison 
            camps with little food and lack of facilities.&nbsp; Their food
            intended for the Cherokee was given to was sold to the locals.&nbsp; The number of losses 
            in the first group was so high that John Ross made an urgent appeal 
            to Scott Requesting that the General let the Cherokees lead the 
            way.&nbsp; Scott granted his request. </p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText">Ross split the large group into smaller ones 
            and led them separately to their new home in Oklahoma.&nbsp; This 
            dramatically decreased the death rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3000
            Cherokee others were 
            forced to march 1,000 miles and then loaded onto boats with 
            facilities equally horrible to the prison camps.&nbsp; A known 4000 died 
            on this horrible journey known as the “Trail of Tears”.</p>
