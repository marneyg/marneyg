        In 1874 Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer was ordered to
        explore&nbsp; Black Hills in the middle of the Lakota Sioux reservation
        to look for future military posts. During this expedition professional
        geologists discovered large deposits of gold in paying quantities, and
        the resultant rush of entrepreneurs to Black Hills was met with violence
        by the Sioux, who considered the whites as unwelcome intruders on a
        sacred ground.</font></b></td>

        On the winter of 1875 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs required all of
        the non-reservation Sioux to report to a reservation by the end of
        January, 1876.&nbsp; This did not work out the way planned so matters

        column was led by General Alfred H. Terry and marched west from Lincoln
        to Bismarck, North Dakota.&nbsp; These columns were said to beat the 800-

        and 1,300 to 1,500 warriors attempted to attack Crook.&nbsp; Crook
        suffered thirty casualties and the Indians suffered twenty.&nbsp; Crook
