        Before barbed wire fences were made of whatever materials were available
        in the area.&nbsp; Wood, stone, earth, or living fences of shrubs.&nbsp;
        Wood was very scarce on the plains and expensive to bring in.&nbsp; Even
        when stone was available it was hard, intensive work and most settlers
        found it impractical.&nbsp; Living fences made up of trees or shrub, such
        as Osage Orange because it grew thick with needles, took many
        trees.&nbsp; Smooth wire was sometimes used but could not hold back
        cattle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

        Jacob Haish was the true inventor of barbed wire.&nbsp; He also invented
        the machine that was used to make the wire in factories.&nbsp; He made

        &quot;Glidden&quot; barbs.&nbsp; He had been going against Glidden from
        the beginning.&nbsp; His factories had given well paying jobs to
        hundreds of men in DeKalb county, Illinois area.&nbsp; In 1884 Haish
        organized the Barb City Bank, of DeKalb.&nbsp; He owned land in 12
        states, 130 houses in DeKalb, and about 12 farms.&nbsp; Although he was

        was named &quot;The Winner&quot; in November 1874.&nbsp; He designed it

        Henry Stanborn was sent to Texas in 1875 to introduce and spread barbed
        wire through out the state.&nbsp; The farmers and ranchers were skeptical
        of the wire.&nbsp; They didn't think it would hold one cow not alone a
        whole herd.&nbsp; They&nbsp; sold very little wire and returned to
        DeKalb a year later.&nbsp; They soon returned to Texas and built a ranch
        with 120 miles of barbed wire fencing.&nbsp; It showed ranchers that it
        would hold cattle back.&nbsp; The ranch was not big enough to prove to
        people how well it worked.&nbsp; In 1881 when the State Capitol burned
        down, to pay for the rebuilding 3 million acres of public land were set
        aside for the Capitol Syndicate of Illinois.&nbsp; In exchange they received
        land that became the XIT Ranch.&nbsp; the X stands for the 10
        counties it covered and the IT stands for in Texas.&nbsp; By 1885 476,000
        acres had been fenced in.&nbsp; The XIT was an example of how the fence
        held the cattle in.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </font></td>

        common for people to put up illegal fences on public lands for their
        cattle.&nbsp; other cattlemen were concerned about loosing public ground
        where they once grazed their livestalk.&nbsp; In 1883 a drought caused tension
        because it was hard for the cattle to find grass and water.&nbsp; During
        the night, groups that thought it was their job to protect public lands,
        cut the wire to drive the squatters from 'their' land.&nbsp; most fence-
        cutters went unpunished and unknown to sheriffs.&nbsp; When thieves and
        cattle rustlers joined fence- cutting things turned violent.&nbsp; They
        cut the fences of innocent farmers.&nbsp; The Texas Legislature made new
        laws in February 1884.&nbsp; They stated that roads and gates had to be
        installed.&nbsp; Putting up a fence without permission became a
        misdemeanor.&nbsp; Fence- cutting became a crime with one to five years
        in prison.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Drift Fences</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early
        1800's drift fences began showing up across the northeast edges of
        various open ranges.&nbsp; They were disconnected sections of fence put
        up to stop the movement of cattle from the north onto depleted grassland
        to the south.&nbsp; They were not meant to enclose the cattle only to
        keep them from entering land where they were unwanted.&nbsp; Fence-
        riders or line- riders set up camps along the wire to drive the cattle
        back north.&nbsp; By 1885 they stretched across the whole north.&nbsp;
        In 1885 sever blizzards hit the plains and drove the cattle south, but
        the drift fences stopped them.&nbsp; Drift fences resulted in the death
        of many cattle- called the &quot;big die up.&quot;&nbsp; They were piled
        up against the mounds of wire.&nbsp; In 1886-87 the cold drove more cattle
        to drift fences causing thousands of dead cattle.&nbsp; The ranchers
        tore down the fences and blamed the wire for all the trouble.&nbsp; They
        said, &quot;the sharp barbs inflicted the wounds on the livestalk that
        left untreated often resulted in pain, infection, and death.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Moonshiners</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people were
        often company salesmen who were unloyal.&nbsp; They sold the same wire
        as their company for a much cheaper price.&nbsp; This caused a serious
        threat to the companies.&nbsp; The first moonshiners were a group lead
        by John Gates.&nbsp; they moved west forming more groups such as the
        Iowa farmers Protection Association.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
