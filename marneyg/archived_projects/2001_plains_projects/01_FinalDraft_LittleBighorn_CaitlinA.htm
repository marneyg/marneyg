      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">March 1875- Professor Waltor P. Jenney
      conducted a geological reconnaissance of the Black Hills.&nbsp; Mr. Jenney
      was under the protection of Lieutenant R.I. Dodge accompanied with 400
      men.&nbsp; The research had proven to find gold.&nbsp; In Montana miners
      demanded better highways.&nbsp; Congress passed a bill on March 1, 1865
      for the California Trail near Fort Laramie to Bozeman in Montana.&nbsp; It
      was protected by military posts.&nbsp; These trails were located on the
      best buffalo hunting ground of the Oglala and Brule tribes. The herds could not
      exist with the trails existing in their location.&nbsp; By March of 1876, 11,000 whites had
      established themselves in Custer City located in the Black Hills.&nbsp;
      Many Sioux and Cheyenne didn't know what to do, so they fled to Sitting
      Bull in Montana.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial">June 17- Crook along with 1,049 men and
      officers fought Crazy Horse in the Battle of Rosebud.&nbsp; Crazy Horse
      won, and fled to Sitting Bull.&nbsp; Late 1875, many Sioux and Cheyenne
      left their reservations to join Sitting Bull and many other Indians that
      had united.&nbsp; Custer used Crow scouts to locate the Indians that had
      all come together in Montana.&nbsp; Once a Crow scout, Red Star, asked Custer,
      &quot;Have you seen the Cutthroats (Sioux)?&quot;&nbsp; When finally the
      Indian camp had been found, Custer also heard that there was maybe forty
      Indian warriors that might have seen them.&nbsp; Custer wanted to strike before the Indians could have a chance to flee.&nbsp; He arranged the
      attack.&nbsp; </font>

        It also could shoot 12-15 times per minute with the proper
        training.&nbsp; The Colt Singleton Action Army revolver, Model
        &quot;P&quot; 1873 was also used by the 7th Calvary.&nbsp; It had a 7.5
        barrel and fired six .45-caliber metallic cartridges with 28 grains of
        black powder.&nbsp; The Single Action had a muzzle velocity of 810 feet

        Benteen would take the left fork at a prairie dog village accompanied

        the camp while Custer, taking the right fork, would attack the other end

        men) were attacking them in broad day light.&nbsp; Reno had surprised
        them.&nbsp; A Thirteen year old Oglala Lakota named Black Elk was
        swimming and playing with fellow friends when he heard the warning.
        Twenty-five year old Eagle Elk, nephew of Crazy Horse, had been dancing
        all night and was just returning.&nbsp; Twenty-six year old White Bull,
        a Minneconjou Lakota, was watering his horses.&nbsp; Indian woman Moving
        Robe was digging up prairie turnips.&nbsp; Her twenty-three year old
        daughter Crawler, a Hunkpapa Lakota, was just standing in the
        valley.&nbsp; Forty year old Hunkpapa Rain-in-the-Face was eating and
        stated, &quot;When I was eating my meat, we heard the war
        cry.&quot;&nbsp; He then dropped his meat and ran out to join the
        battle.&nbsp; One Bull, Sitting Bull's nephew, was combing his
        hair.&nbsp; Wooden Leg, a Cheyenne, was fast asleep, so were
        Turtle Rib, Red Feather, and Low Dog.&nbsp; Low Dog thought it was a
        false alarm Saying, &quot;I
        could not believe it possible that the whites would attack us, so strong
        as we were.&quot;&nbsp; Sitting Bull's wife Four Robes was so scared
        that she only grabbed one of her twin babies and ran to the hills.&nbsp;
        She realized her mistake and came back to get her other child, whom

        </span>On July 17, Colonel Wesley Merritt’s 5<sup>th</sup> Calvary
        drove back 1,000 Northern Cheyenne at Bonnet Creek that were trying to

        surrendered at Red Cloud agency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many
        towns had organized troops consisting of townsmen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Many disarmed the Indians, taking them as hostile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        their ponies and sold them to buy the Indians cows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Congress took the Black Hills and their hunting rights outside
        the reservation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the

        the Indians won the Battle of Little Bighorn, in a sense of reality,
        they lost the over all war.&nbsp; It's quite ironic though.&nbsp; With
        such a
        victory, you would think, would result to a win for their freedom.&nbsp;
        Instead the victory made matters worse as you just read in Following the
        Battle.&nbsp; The U.S. didn't trust the Indians any more.&nbsp;
        Their misery became even more miserable.&nbsp;</span></font><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</td>
