        the most dangerous maneuvers of the trap.&nbsp; One the day of the
        massacre, the warriors finally got all the soldiers in the spot they

        was one that said that any Sioux that didn't report to the Great Sioux
        Reservation by January 31 was considered hostile.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
        many Indians didn't hear about this until after the deadline.&nbsp; On March
        17, 1876, General Crook attacked a Cheyenne and Sioux camp on the Powder
        River.&nbsp; The Indians were driven from their lodges, and many were
        killed.&nbsp; Their lodges and winter supplies were burned.&nbsp;
        General Crook and his men also stole the Indians' horse herd.&nbsp;

        be three miles long and a half a mile wide, but it was really seven
        miles long.&nbsp; Along with that mistake came another.&nbsp; There were
        three times as many warriors in that village as in the whole 7th
        Calvary.&nbsp; Reno's squadron of 175 men were surrounded in an indefensible
