      <td width="100%" colspan="2">&nbsp; Born in New Rumley , Ohio, Custer lead a simple
        life. After high school , however, He decided to change that. He went to
        West Point, unfortunately he failed any chances at recognizable achievements.
        Seven days after graduating he failed to do his duty as a member of the
        guard to stop a fight. He was court-marshaled , but the need for&nbsp;
        Civil War officers saved him from expulsion. Custer did well in the war. He served in the battles of
        Bull Run (the first one ), Virginia, and Gettysburg. Though he lost many
        men, even by the war's standards, his determination earned him the respect of the other generals and
        the public as well. His forces played a crucial part in the defeat of
        the south at Appomattox. Gen. Grant gave him the Appomattox surrender
        table as a reward.
        <p>&nbsp; In the July of 1866, Custer became the lieutenant- coronal of
        the 7th cavalry. In 1867 he helped lead a campaign against the Cheyenne
        with his men. Late into the year Custer was court-marshaled
        (again!!)&nbsp; and suspended for 1 year for being absent from his
        command. Custer believed that he was the scapegoat for a bad campaign.
        Gen. Philip Sheridan agreed , reactivating Custer in 1868. Custer
        redeemed himself by the attack on Black Kettle's tribe on the Wichita river.
        In 1873 he was sent to the Northern Plains. There he engaged the
        Lakota in small battles. The following year he and 1,200 other men, went
        to claim the Black Hills. These , consequently, had been&nbsp; promised
        to the Lakota 6 yrs. earlier.</p>
        <p>Custer was to lead an anti-Lakota expedition with Gen. John Gibbon&nbsp;
        and Gen. George Crook. He almost missed this because of his testament
        to Indian Services corruption, Grant was furious and relieved him of
        command and he was replaced by Gen. Alfred Tory. Public disgust with this
        decision ,however , caused Grant to reverse his decision. Custer headed
        West. The first U.S. plan to beat the Lakota required 3 forces
        ,under the control of Crook, Gibbon, &amp; Custer, to trap the main
        force of Indians in-between them and defeat them. Custer came across a
        large village (boy was he in for a surprise) on June 25, 1876. His
        advance had put him far ahead of the other units one of which&nbsp; had
        been turned back by Crazy Horse.</p>
        <p>Custer ordered an attack on the village. underestimating the Indians
        prowess Custer split his force into 3 groups. The attack was a disaster.
        Thousands of Indians forced them back, surrounded them and kill everyone
        of them. Though his mistake proved fatal, Custer's fame was
        unparalleled. His wife wrote books on him. She described him as a smart,
        well-mannered gentleman, and a politician. Many paintings of Custer's
        Last Stand have been produced. In many he was depicted almost as a
        martyr. The fact he started the fight faded into irrelevancy.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
