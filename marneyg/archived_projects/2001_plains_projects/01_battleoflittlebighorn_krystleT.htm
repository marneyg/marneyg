      <p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mid 1800s, Indians in Montana were sick and tired of
      living on a reservation.&nbsp; They bravely left their reservation and
      set up a village that was three miles long on the banks of the Little
      Bighorn River.&nbsp;&nbsp; The village was set around Sitting Bull who was
      a highly respected Indian chief.&nbsp; The United States Military wanted
      the Indians on a reservation so they sent soldiers under the command of Lieutenant
      Colonel George Armstrong&nbsp; Custer to drive the Indians back.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S.'s original plan was to have three forces under
      the commands of John Gibbon, George Crook, and George Custer.&nbsp; They were
      going to trap the Indians from all sides and attack.&nbsp; It looked like
      a very easy win over the Indians.&nbsp; No one expected the surprising outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By early June the three forces were riding towards the
      Indian's encampment.&nbsp; Everything was going smoothly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then,
      on June 17, 1876 Crook's force ran into Crazy Horse's band
      of warriors at Rosebud Creek.&nbsp; Crook's force couldn't defeat the
      Indians, so they turned around.&nbsp; Gibbon and Custer had no idea that
      Crook was no longer going to make it to the battle.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting Bull had a vision of a great battle that was going
      to take place.&nbsp; His vision came to him about one month before the
      Battle of the Little Bighorn.&nbsp; It told him the Indians would have a
      great win and a great loss as well.</font></p>

      Gibbon's everyday.&nbsp; On June 22, 1876 Custer left Rosebud Creek and marched his soldiers seventy-eight miles
      in twenty-four hours towards the Little Bighorn River. Then on June
      25 Custer noticed Sitting Bull's village.&nbsp;
      He saw about 40 Indian warriors and, despite being ordered not to, he attacked them before they could warn other Indian warriors that they had been
            found.</font></td>

              Major Marcus Reno had about 175 soldiers who attack the
      north end of the encampment.&nbsp; Quickly they realized that they had
      little hope against all the Indians.&nbsp; Reno halted his charging men
      before they were trapped.&nbsp; The men fought for about ten minutes
      before retreating to the nearby brush for protection.&nbsp; It offered
      little relief so they backed farther up a hill with a large band of Cheyenne
      and Sioux pursuing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

      them.&nbsp; With their position looking desperate, Custer ordered his men
      to shoot their horses and position them to form a wall.&nbsp; The horses
      didn't help very much.&nbsp; The U.S. was outnumbered four to one and as a
      result, soon all 210 members of the Seventh Calvary were dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After one more day of fighting with no news from Custer,

      Indian women popped his eardrums so he would hear better in his
      afterlife.&nbsp; Custer had made a promise to the Indians which said that
      he couldn't attack the Cheyenne and the Cheyenne couldn't attack
      him.&nbsp; They told Custer that if he broke his promise they would kill every last one of the
      soldiers Custer had.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still the Indians starved.&nbsp; Some made it to freedom

      <p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several questions about the Battle of Little
      Bighorn that we may never find out.&nbsp; Some people say Custer was a
      hero and others say he was too ambitious.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few people think that if Crook and
      Gibbon's forces would have been there the U.S. would
      have won.&nbsp; The battle was nicknamed &quot;Custer's Last Stand&quot; because to
      everyone's astonishment, Custer died in a battle that was supposed to be an easy
      victory.&nbsp; In the end, the Indians went to the reservations and the white
      men stayed living on the other land.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
