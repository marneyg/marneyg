        September 17, 1868.&nbsp; The Indians encampment had just learned that
        they were being trailed by the soldiers.&nbsp; The warriors in the camp
        began gathering their ponies and applying there war paint.&nbsp; At the
        head of the warriors was the brave leader, Roman Nose.&nbsp; Meanwhile
        Forsythe's men were unaware that they had been discovered by the
        Indians.&nbsp; The soldiers set up camp for the evening.&nbsp; The
        number of the Indians were about or around 600.&nbsp; Many tribes were
        involved such as the Arapaho, (Roman Noses tribe the Cheyenne) and the
        Sioux.&nbsp; At dawn the Indians streamed down on the soldiers
        camp.&nbsp; The first charge of Indians was driven back, but a lot of
        Forsythe men were lost.&nbsp; More warriors keep attacking.&nbsp; As one
        of the soldiers was fling for his life, Forsythe drew his pistol and
        announced,&nbsp; that he would kill any man that tried leave or
        retreat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>

        turn, as he entered the field it gave all the Indians a great boost to
        the attacking forces.&nbsp; Forsythe then set up a massive volley.&nbsp;
        When the all the warriors were around 50 feet away they shot.&nbsp;
        Warriors were falling like flies.&nbsp; But they still charged.&nbsp; As
        Roman Nose passed the soldiers a built caught him in the back.&nbsp; He
        did not fall off his horse until he reached the other side of the
        river.&nbsp; Still the Indians keep on fighting.&nbsp; That night
        Forsythe sent to guys to Fort Wallace for help.&nbsp; The two men got
        the newly formed Black Tenth Calvary, they just about demolished the Indians.&nbsp;
        The Indians had disappear into the hills.&nbsp; Forsythe was shot three
        times but he survived.&nbsp; The shot in the back by one of the soldiers
