      <td width="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Custer was born on December 5,
        1859, in New Rumley, Ohio.&nbsp; His dad was Emmanuel Henry and his mom
        was Ward Kirk Patrick Custer. While he was growing up he always wanted
        to be a soldier.&nbsp; He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in
        1861.&nbsp; He ranked last in his class.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Custer fought
        at the Battle of Bull Run, his fearless aggression is what got him
        respect from his commanding generals.&nbsp; By the time he was 23, he
        was a brigadier general and at 25, he was made a major
        general.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1886, Custer became lieutenant
        colonel of the 7th Cavalry.&nbsp; His friend, General L. Sheridan, agreed to bring
        Custer back to duty in 1868.&nbsp; He was sent to the northern plains in
        1873.&nbsp; Where in a few small skirmishes with the Lakota in the
        Yellowstone wilderness, he began to be known as a great Indian fighter
        and a hero to the American people.&nbsp; .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1876, he was scheduled
        to lead part of the anti-Lakota expedition. On June 25, Custer's scouts
        found a Indian village in the valley of the Little Big Horn.&nbsp;
        Custer expected to find about 1000 warriors and he believed that his 650
        soldiers could easily take over the village.&nbsp; But instead there
        were 2000 warriors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lakota and Cheyenne warriors
        were out gunned but they fought bravely and gave the Army its worst
        defeat of the entire Indian War.&nbsp; Custer lead approximately 210 men
        to their deaths. He divided the 7th Cavalry into three divisions.&nbsp;
        He then divided his immediate command into wings.&nbsp; This
        decision&nbsp; to divide his troops may not have been the best decision
        in the face of the overwhelming enemy, but it was an accepted and past
        tested military tactic.&nbsp; This tactic had been successful until this
        battle.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thousands of Lakota and Cheyenne warriors
        fought hard and pushed Custer and his men back into a long and dusty
        ridge parallel to the Little Big Horn.&nbsp; They were surrounded by the
        enemy and then had no chance to escape. The battle may have only lasted
        an hour. Everyone of Custer's men were killed, making this attack one of
        the greatest fiascos of the United States Army's history.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Through Custer's blunders he lost his life, but he gained ever lasting
        fame.&nbsp; Custer was found on the battle field in Montana where he
        made his last stand at Custer Hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people of America were stunned that a
        group of Indians could defend their village and kill such a well-known
        officer and all his men.&nbsp; There was controversy about why the army
        and Custer were defeated.&nbsp; Custer's enemies said that he had
        disobeyed orders by attacking the village.&nbsp; The supporters of
        Custer said that he had been abandoned when Major Reno retreated.&nbsp;
        Others blamed it on the miscalculation of the number of warriors who
        were in the village.&nbsp; But no one really knows the answer.</p>
