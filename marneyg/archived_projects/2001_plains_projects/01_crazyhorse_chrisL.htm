        visionary leader committed to preserving the traditions and values of
        the Lakota way of life which was recognized by his people.&nbsp; As a young man Crazy Horse was a
        legendary warrior he stole horses from the Crow Indians.&nbsp; When he
        was 5 or 6 his band got snowed in, in a severe snowstorm he went out two
        days later and brought back two antelopes for every one had an enough
        food for two days.&nbsp; The next day he asked his mom for food but
        there wasn't any left and his mom said: &quot;Remember my son they went
        home singing praises in your name not my name or your fathers.&nbsp; You
        must be brave.&nbsp; You must live up to your reputation.&quot; Often
        when he was young the Sioux called him the strange one.&nbsp; When he
        was 16 he joined a party against Gros Ventres.&nbsp; When he was still
        18-19 there was a great buffalo hunt when he got back he had 10 of
        them.&nbsp; Crazy Horses mom was a sister of Brule Chief spotted tail
        and his father was an Oglala medicine man who often wanted to drive out
        the whites.&nbsp;</font></td>
