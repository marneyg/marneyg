      Tatanka Iyotake or Sitting
      Bull as he was later called. Was born in 1831. During his childhood his
      nickname was Huntesi which mean slow. He got this nickname because he
      always took his time and never hurried. At the age of ten he killed his
      first buffalo. Than at the age of four-teen he joined his first war party
      against the Crow. During this battle he counted coup for the first time against
      the enemy without their knowing. He soon became known for his fearlessness
      in battle. His father gave him the name Sitting Bull meaning one who sits
      on his haunches. Sitting Bull soon became the leader of the &quot;Strong
      Heart warriors Society.&quot; Sitting Bull also successfully increased the
      Sioux's hunting grounds. In 1867 Sitting Bull became the 1st Principal
      Chief of the Teton Sioux nation. He was thirty-six. </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Little Bighorn Sitting Bull had a vision. In that vision he saw hundreds
      of soldiers falling from the sky like grasshoppers. They were falling on
      their camp. At the battle of the Rosebud. The Oglala tribe led by Crazy
      Horse joined up with Sitting Bull to make Crook retreat. To celebrate the
      tribes moved their camp to the Valley of the Little Bighorn. There they
      were joined by 3,000 more Indians who had also left their reservation to
      join Sitting Bull. On June 25th Sitting Bull vision proved to be true.
      General George Armstrong Custer thinking he was attacking a small
      encampment led the 7th Calvary into a straight on charge right to the
      center of the three mile long camp. Custer found out too late that there
      were thousands upon thousands of Indians camped along the Little Bighorn.
      The Indian warriors came after Custer and his men like maddened hornets.
      Custer trying to retreat was stuck on a nearby ridge. Surrounded by
      Indians Custer was killed along with 264 of his men the Indians lost no
      more than sixty warriors. The Battle of the Little Bighorn came to be
      known as Custer's Last Stand.</font>
