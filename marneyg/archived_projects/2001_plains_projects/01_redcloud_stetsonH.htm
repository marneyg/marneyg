      <td width="100%">Red Cloud was born in 1822 near the forks of the Platte
        River, now North Platte, Nebraska.&nbsp; In his youth his father died,
        his mother couldn't raise him so he was raised by his uncle, Chief
        Smoke.&nbsp; His first battles were against his neighbors, the Crow
        Pawnee.&nbsp; He has been called the greatest leader of there tribes.
        Even though his was raised to be a&nbsp; warrior, but his courage and battle
        bravery won him the title of Chief Red Cloud.
        <p>In 1851 Plains tribes meet government agents at the first Fort
        Laramie Treaty.&nbsp; Indians granted right-of-way for settlers through
        Indian territory in exchange for government annuity. In 1860 he successfully
        stopped the U.S. from building the forts on the reservation.&nbsp; In
        the 1860's he successfully stopped the U.S. soldiers from building the
        forts on the Lakota reservation.&nbsp; In 1865 he stopped the U.S.
        soldiers from building a road through Wyoming. In 1862 and 1863 Red
        Cloud was haunted by the vision of the Minnesota expulsion of the Lakota
        . </p>
        <p>&nbsp;In 1866 the U.S. army constructed forts along the Bozeman trail. Which
        ran through the Lakota territory, (present day Wyoming), and Montana's
        gold fields from Colorado's south Platte River. So in the winter of 1866
        Red Cloud launched a series of attacks on the forts. Defeating
        Lieutenant Colonel William Fettermans column of 80 men at Fort Kearny. </p>

        these forts for two years. Also in 1866 he assumed leadership of the
        Sioux and Cheyenne. In 1868 the U.S. agreed to burn the forts in the
        Fort Laramie on April 28,1868.&nbsp; The U.S. government tricked
        Red&nbsp; Cloud by him signing himself to a different&nbsp; reservation.
        He did not know that the treaty made him move to a different
        reservation.
        <p>Red Cloud through out his life made a lot of different quotes. Here
        are some of them.</p>
        <p>&quot;I was born a Lakota and I shall die a Lakota.&nbsp; Before the
        white man came to our country, the Lakota's were free people, they made
        there own laws and governed themselves as it seemed good to them. The priest
        and ministers tell us that we lived wickedly when we lived before the
        white man came among us.&nbsp; Whose fault us these?&nbsp; We lived
        right as we were taught it was right.&nbsp; Shall we be punished for
        this? I am not sure that what these people tell me is
        true.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Red Cloud </p>
        <p>&quot;Look at me. I was a warrior on this land where the sun rises,
        now I come from where the sun sets.&nbsp; Whose voice was first
        surrounded on this land-the red people with bows and arrows. The Great
        Father says he is good and kind to us .&nbsp; I can't see
        it.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Red Cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
