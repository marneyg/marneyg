&nbsp;The word Apache may have come from the Zuni word Apachu meaning &#8220;enemy.&#8221;
It also could have come from Awa&#8217;tehe, the Ute name for Apache. They arrived
between 1000 A.D. and 1400 A.D. in the southwest. After being separated from
their northern kinsmen, they ended up carving out a home in the south along
the east side of the Rocky Mountains. Their tribe then ended up spreading
west into New Mexico and Arizona. The Apaches were nomadic Indians and lived
off Buffalo. They killed the animals for their hides, which they used for
clothes and tents, and meat to eat. This tribe was one of the first, besides
the Pueblos, to learn to ride horses.       </span><br

they became a band. Different men led different expeditions, but there was
never just one leader for a band nor was there ever only one chief over all

&nbsp;A woman&#8217;s pregnancy is very different from today. When a mother was
expecting she wore a maternity
belt that was made of skins from deer, mountain lions, or pronghorn antelope.
These animals were believed to not have much difficulty having birth. Traditionally
at the time of birth a medicine man would conduct a ritual. In more recent
times a midwife attended the mother. The midwife&#8217;s job was to squirt the baby
with water, which had been warmed in her mouth, and then rub the baby dry.
They used grass, moss, or cloth that had been sprinkled in cattail pollen.
A few days after the child is born a medicine sing is held to name the baby.</span><br>

&nbsp;Marriage was very important to the Apaches. The man&#8217;s parents arranged
the wedding. Usually the male asked an old female relative to approach the
woman&#8217;s family. If the offer was accepted the man presented gifts to the
other family such as hoses, blankets, and guns. In return, the family that
received the gifts would give the other family smaller gift backs. When getting
married the two families would not have a ceremony. A dwelling would be placed
by the female&#8217;s parents home. The man would then live at the wives camp with
the door facing away from her parents. Out of respect the male wasn&#8217;t supposed
to talk to his mother-in-law. They believed that to eliminate conflict and
insure harmony between the two households. After marriage a man was expected
to support his own parents plus his wives parents.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

body they buried the possessions too. The body could be placed in caves or
on cliffs between rocks. The location of the grave was never mentioned. And

moved to a different location, because it was forbidden to speak of the dead.</span><br>

&nbsp;They had very peaceful trade with the Pueblos until the Spanish forced
the Pueblos to work their farms. The Pueblos then became unwilling to trade
with the nomadic Indians so they raided for horses and supplies. The first
contact the Apaches had with the Spanish was in 1541 when Francisco Vazquez
de Coronado and his men encountered a band of Apaches at Querechos on their
journey to Quivira. Continuous raids made the Spanish settlers and the Pueblo
Indians suffer a lot.</span><br>

&nbsp;The Pueblo Revolt was very important to the Apache. In 1680 the Spaniards
were driven out of New Mexico because the Pueblos had to revolt. Raids, in
conjunction with drought, harsh Spanish rule, and missionary activities led
to the revolt. In 1692 the Spaniards required New Mexico. Wherever desired,
the Apache, a powerful nation of Indians, raided with impunity. The Comanche&#8217;s
pressured the Apaches from the north because of the aggressive behavior that
turned neighbors into enemies. In the 1700 they started to migrate south
and west as the Comanche, Wichita, and the Tejas began occupying dominant
position on the south plains. Plains culture was very hard for the tribe
to adapt to. Tending fields of food, they attempted to improve food sources.
They spent a lot of time in the fields, that the Comanche&#8217;s knew where to
launch raids. The Comanche&#8217;s became stronger, but at the same time the Apaches
grew weaker.</span><br>
