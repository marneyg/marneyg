Riley and Ft. Larned were two of the most important forts in the middle 1800&#8217;s.&nbsp;
They were both used to protect wagon trains and merchants along the Santa
Fe and Oregon Trails.&nbsp; Both forts had an escorting system to help wagon
trains move safely along the Trails.&nbsp; Wagons could not pass either fort
without an escort.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

the formation of the 7th cavalry.&nbsp; Lieutenant Colonel George Custer took
command of the 7th cavalry.&nbsp; From Ft. Riley, the cavalry rode to famous
battles such as Beecher&#8217;s Island, Washita River, and the Battle of Little
Bighorn.&nbsp; Ft. Riley stood as the major horse cavalry training school
and was boasted one of the best in the World.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the frontier forts closed, due to the lessening
conflicts with the Indians.&nbsp; Ft. Riley escaped this fate when Lieutenant
General Philip Sheridan recommended to Congress to make Ft. Riley &#8220;Cavalry
Headquarters of the Army.&#8221; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;               &nbsp; &nbsp;Shortly after its formation, the
9th cavalry, also known as the buffalo soldiers, passed through Ft. Riley
in route to permanent stations in the southwest.&nbsp; They returned during
the early 1880&#8217;s. &nbsp;</td>

on the plains during the Plains Indians War.&nbsp; It is unchanged from its
original design and furnished with furniture from 1880 to 1890.&nbsp; It
is believed that Mr. And Mrs. Custer occupied either this or the sister-set
of quarters while stationed there in 1866.<br>

Ft. Larned is located near Pawnee Fork.&nbsp; The post was originally named
&#8220;Camp on Pawnee Fork,&#8221; then later, it was named &#8220;Camp Alert,&#8221; because troops
had to be constantly alert for Indians.&nbsp; The fort was eventually named
Fort Larned.<br>

Fort Larned also used as an agency for the Administration of the Central
Plains Indians by the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the terms of the Fort
Wise Treaty in 1861.&nbsp; Two other treaties that were important to Ft.
Larned were the Treaty of the Little Arkansas in 1865, and the Medicine Lodge
Treaty in 1867.&nbsp; Throughout the 1860&#8217;s, the fort served as an agency
of the Indian Bureau, as the government attempted to find a peaceful solution
to the conflicts.&nbsp; <br>

to strike, while the Civil War sent many troops to the east.&nbsp; Indian
raids and harassment of travelers along the Santa Fe Trail increased, forcing
travelers to seek protection in Ft. Larned.&nbsp; On July 17, 1864, Kiowa
Indians raided Ft. Larned and stole 172 horses and mules from the corral.&nbsp;
They were pursued, but never caught.&nbsp; In 1871, people traveling along
the Santa Fe Trail needed some help continuing with their journey.&nbsp; Indians
were raiding wagon trains and stealing horses, so an escorting system was
established.&nbsp; All wagon trains and merchants were not allowed to travel
westward beyond Ft. Larned without an escort. <br>
