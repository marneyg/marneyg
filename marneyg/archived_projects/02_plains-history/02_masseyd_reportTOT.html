marched over 1,200 miles of rugged land. Over 4,000 of these Indians died
of disease, famine, and warfare. The Indian tribe was called &nbsp;the Cherokee
and we call this event the Trail of Tears. As you will soon learn, it is
one of the most brutal and racist events to happen in America.</td>

De Soto took his adventures to America. After he came to America more and
more Europeans came and began to invade on Indian land. The Indians became
lost in bewilderment and anger. Some tribes didn&#8217;t feel this way until later
on, for some helped the new comers win wars during the colonial periods.
Often when the Indians&#8217; side lost the war, the Indians would have to give
up a large portion of their land. So as you can see the greed for Indian
Territory started early.</td>

of the way. President Andrew Jackson said, &#8221;The Indian Removal Act will place
a dense population in large tracts of the country now occupied by a few savage
hunters.&#8221; This era was popular with voters. However, not everyone agreed.
Davy Crockette was a very strong opponent. He once said, &#8220; I would sooner
be honestly damned than hypocritically immortalized.&#8221; The act passed regardless.

they had to give up their lands when they had been living on them for so
long. Aitoweyah, a Cherokee Indian , wrote a letter to John Ross saying, &#8220;
We the people think only of the love we have for our land for&#8230; we do love
the land where we were brought up. We will never let our hold to this land

the mothers of the Cherokee tribes were grieving so much that they were unable
to help their children survive the journey. The elders prayed for a sign that
would lift the mothers&#8217; spirits and give them strength. The next day a beautiful
rose began to grow where each of the mothers&#8217; tears had fallen. The rose
is white for the tears that were shed, it has a gold center that shows the
gold stolen form the Cherokee, and seven leaves that represent the seven
Cherokee clans. The wild Cherokee Rose grows along the route of the Trail
of Tears into Eastern Oklahoma to this day.</td>
