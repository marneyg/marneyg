for both General McClellan and General Plearsonton. Once Autie as he was
nicknamed from childhood, was ordered to cross a creek. After Custer crossed
the creek he spotted an enemy picket post. George then crossed back over,
and asked permission if he could lead an attack on the enemy. The following
morning Custer lead an attack on the picket post. He drove back the enemy,
and captured some of the first colors of the Army of the Potamac. Custer
fought in many of the civil war battles. He fought at Peninsular, Anetam,
and Chancellorsville.</big></td>

&nbsp; &nbsp;In June 1863 Custer was promoted to Brigadier General at the
age of 23 making him the youngest Brig. Gen. of the war. After he was promoted
he took command of the Michigan Cavalry Brigade. With this command Gen. Custer
fought at Gettysburg, where he helped keep Gen. Stuart from turning the left
flank. He also fought at Bristoe and Mine Run. Custer was with Gen. Sheridan
when he led a cavalry raid on Richmond. At the battle of Yellow Tavern the
colors were only saved by Custer hiding them in his shirt and fleeing. At
the battle of Woodstock George drove his former classmate General Rosser back
26 miles and captured everything on wheels except one gun. At the end of
the war Custer&#8217;s command had the highest casualty rate of any other officer.&nbsp;</span></big></td>

&nbsp; &nbsp;After 10 months had gone by Gen. Sheridan reinstated Custer.
After his reinstatement he fought at the battle of Washita. Custer considered
this to be a great victory. In 1876 The Lt. Col. was assigned to follow General
Alfred H. Terry. Custer was sent up the Rosebud River to locate the Indians.
After finding the Indians he was to wait on reinforcements. Including two
gatling guns and a larger group of cavalrymen. Instead he decided to attack.
Not knowing he was outnumbered by Crazy horse, Gall and hundreds of other
Indians. He split his forces three ways. One group went with Maj. Reno and
another with Cap. Benteen. They were to flank to the outside so less Indians
would escape. Custer led his group straight into the camp of Indians. Custer
and all 264 of the men that went straight into the camp were killed.&nbsp;</span></big></td>
