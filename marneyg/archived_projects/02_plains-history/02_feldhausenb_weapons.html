didn&#8217;t know before about the weapons used in the Indian wars of the 1800&#8217;s.
The Indians in this time were highly advanced for their time they had very
good strategies about fighting their enemies. The Indians fought to show their
bravery by touching the enemy&nbsp;&nbsp; with a cue stick before they got
killed to show their bravery. When the people in the tribe see bravery in
a warrior they can try to raise his position in the tribe, and try to become
chief. <br>

    <tr>
      <td valign="top">The weapons the Indians are using were overwhelming
to the Calvary. Their main weapon was the bow and arrow because they were
quite and had good accuracy. An average Indian was as accurate at twenty-five
yards as a marksman was at a hundred yards with a rifle. The warriors who
would use it crafted their own bows. The warrior would put in their best skills
into making their own bow and arrows. A warrior would cut down the limb and
mark the top because it was said, &#8220;If the bow was pointing the way it was
growing it would function better.&#8221; When you got your limb you would let it
air dry for four to five years to become completely dry and to be shaped.
If a warrior needed a bow quickly he would take the limb that has dried the
longest and shape it and dry it over a bed of coals. An old saying &#8220;A wooden
bow fully drawn is nine tenths broken.&#8221; This means that a wooden bow was
nine tenths broken when it is pilled to its max pull. For the bow to function
right it has to bend in a perfect arch from the handle to the tip. This has
to be so all the parts of the bow do their part. The decoration of the bow
is usually painted blue and yellow to represent the lighting bolt. They did
this to give it the power of the lighting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

little shot foe handling. The lance is a pole with an attached blade nine
to ten inches long. The handle was made of a hard wood sometimes rapped in
rawhide. Blades were made out of either flint or obsidian, and when the white
man moved west they took the iron off of the wagon wheel to cut and shape
into blades for knives, lances and others.&nbsp; <br>

was the shield? Before the horses became easily available their shields were
big and covered the whole body. After you could get horses easily they made
their shields smaller so they could maneuver it with one hand. All their shields
were made of rawhide mostly from the hump of the buffalo. They used three
to four foot round pieces of rawhide. Then they would shrink it to eighteen
inches in diameter. The decorations were important because they said the
symbols gave that warrior power in battle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <td valign="top">Some of the main hand-to-hand combat weapons of the
Indians were the tomahawk and the knife. A tomahawk is a wood handle with
rawhide around it. They mostly used stone or iron for the head of the tomahawk.
Some chiefs hollowed out the handle and made a bowl and the back of the head
and made apiece pipe out of it. The knife was not only a weapon but it was
a tool, an eating utensil, and a cooking utensil all in one. They first had
a wood or bone handle with a stone blade. When the white man came they traded
and got steal blades to put on their knives. The sheath was what the Indians
used to carry their knives; it was rawhide with a wood inner layer. They decorated
their sheaths with all sorts of things. I will give you a few of the most
common. For the sheath they had beads, fringes, and hair. The tomahawk was
decorated with by branding, brass tacks, and rapped with copper and brass
wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

of war clubs? The three main types are the JawBone, Gunstock, and the Ball
Headed war clubs were what they used most. A jawbone war club is a wood shaft
that has a jaw bone from a buffalo or deer that has the teeth filed down so
it hurts more when it hits you. You can probably guess what the gunstock war
club looks like. It is a wood paddle that has blades coming out of the side.
They decorated it with brass tacks, paint, and appendages were the favorites.
A ball headed war club is what it sounds like it is a wood shaft with a round
stone on the end. The ball ranged in size from three to five inches around.
The war club was designed to disable the enemy not kill it. They mostly went
for the knees, upper arms and the legs because an enemy that can&#8217;t attack
can&#8217;t hurt you.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

One of their primary weapons was the colt .45, the Springfield, the Winchester

that had a 7.5-inch barrel. This pistol was a center fire cartridge, six-shooter.
The colt was what they relied on when they didn&#8217;t have time to get out their
rifles. <br>
