The Sioux Indian&#8217;s lives were destroyed.&nbsp; The buffalo were gone.&nbsp;
Themselves were confined to reservations dependent on Indian Agents for their
existence.&nbsp; All that changed when in a desperate attempt to return to
the days of their glory, many sought salvation in a new mysticism preached
by Wovoka, a Paiute Shaman.&nbsp; Emissaries from the Sioux people in South
Dakota traveled to Nevada to hear his words.&nbsp; He called his self the
Messiah and prophesied that the dead would soon join the kiving in a world
where they could live the old way in peace with plenty of game.&nbsp; To
hasten the event, the Indians were to dance the Ghost Dance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

of the Military Department of the Missouri.&nbsp; He was also in charge of
the army in this area, and therefore could be considered the most important
single non-Indian source of information on Wounded Knee.&nbsp; When the soldiers
and Indians finally met, Big Foot rose from his bed to greet Major Samuel
Whitside of the Seventh calvary.&nbsp; His blankets were stained crimson
and blood dripped from his nose as he spoke.&nbsp; Whitside gave Big Foot
orders to take his band to their camp on Wounded Knee Creek.&nbsp; Big Foot
told Whitside that they were headed that way, to Pine Ridge.&nbsp; The major
wanted to disarm the Indians instantly, but was talked out of it by his scout,
John Shangreau, in order to prevent instigating a fight right then and there.&nbsp;
They agreed to wait until they reached camp.&nbsp; Then the major ordered
his army ambulance to transport the ill chief and provide him with a warmer
and more comfortable ride.<br>
