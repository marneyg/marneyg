Oregon, Washington, and Idaho there was a great chief.&nbsp; This chief over
time won the respect of many whites on the East coast.&nbsp; He led many
other Indians towards freedom in Canada 1,400 miles away.&nbsp; On their
way they had to fight and avoid the army. This great chief &nbsp;was Chief
Joseph of the Nez Perce.

day Oregon.&nbsp; His real name was not Joseph.&nbsp; Joseph was his Christian
name.&nbsp; His real name was Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekt, which means Thunder
Rolling down from the Mountains.&nbsp; Joseph had a younger brother only
a couple years younger than him.&nbsp; His brothers name was Ollokot.&nbsp;
Joseph and Ollokot spent much of their childhood on a Christian missionary.
The Nez Perce was a friendly tribe and made their first contact with whites
in 1805 with Lewis and Clark.&nbsp; The Nez Perce didn&#8217;t mind the whites
as long as there was peace between them.Joseph eventually died at Collville
Reservation, in the Northeastern part of Washington, on September 21, 1904
from a broken heart.&nbsp; However he didn&#8217;t die until after long hard fight.<p><br>

with the United States saying that they can keep their traditional homeland.&nbsp;
That land included Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.&nbsp; In 1863 near Clearwater
gold was discovered.&nbsp; The whites started to move into the Nez Perce&#8217;s
homeland.&nbsp; So the government made another treaty reducing the Nez Perce&#8217;s
homeland.&nbsp; Old Joseph refused to sign the treaty. &nbsp;In 1871 Old
Joseph died.&nbsp; In that same year Joseph the Younger got voted into being
chief.<p><br>

      <td valign="top">Chief Joseph thought that since Old Joseph didn&#8217;t
sign the treaty that he wasn&#8217;t bound to it. In 1863 the government then started
to remove the whites but after a few years the government reversed itself.&nbsp;
General Howard then threatened a cavalry attack.&nbsp; Scared for his people
Chief Joseph, Looking Glass, Eagle From the Light, White Bird, and Toohoolzote
moved their bands towards the Lapwai Reservation.&nbsp; These 5 chiefs were
known as the &#8220;non-treaty&#8221; chiefs because they wouldn&#8217;t sign any treaties.&nbsp;
After a while Chief Joseph became the non-treaty chiefs spokesperson.&nbsp;
The 5 bands consisted of about 700 men, women, and children. One of Joseph&#8217;s
speeches about the whites was: &#8220;All men were made by the same Great Spirit.&nbsp;
They are all brothers.&nbsp; The earth is the mother of all people, and all
people should have equal rights upon it.&#8221; &nbsp;Since Chief Joseph didn't
want to go to&nbsp; war with the army he tried to persuade the other chiefs
not to go to war . &nbsp;Eventually he succeeded.</td>

mobilized 500 men after the Nez Perce.&nbsp; On July 11, 1877 Howard met
up with them near South Forkin, Idaho.&nbsp; Howard charged the Nez Perce
camp and would have ended the chase if he would of followed through with
the victory.&nbsp; The battle lasted two days.&nbsp; It lasted this long
because the Nez Perce fought with un-Indian like skills.&nbsp; Later this
battle was known as the Battle of Clearwater.&nbsp; As the battles went on
Joseph stayed behind at camp to guard the women and children while Ollokot
led the warriors.&nbsp; Eventually the Nez Perce proved to be the better
fighters and the better marksman. &nbsp;<p><br>

the Bitterroot Mountains to seek aid from the Crow or Sitting Bull and the
Sioux in Canada.&nbsp; However they never got that far.&nbsp; General Howard
sent orders to Colonel Nelson Miles to intercept the Nez Perce.&nbsp; On

Chief Joseph&#8217;s surrender speech he said this, &#8220;I am tired of fighting.&nbsp;
Our chiefs are dead.&nbsp; Looking Glass is dead.&nbsp; Toohoolzote is dead.&nbsp;
The old men are dead.&nbsp; It is young men who say &#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;No&#8217;.&nbsp;
Ollokot is dead. &nbsp; It is cold and we have no blankets.&nbsp; The little
children are freezing to death.&nbsp; My people, some of them, have run away
to the hills and have no blankets, no food.&nbsp; No one knows where they
are&#8230;perhaps freezing to death.&nbsp; I want to have time to look for my children
and see how many I can find.&nbsp; Maybe I shall find them among the dead.
&nbsp;Hear me, my chiefs. I am tired, my heart is sick and sad.&nbsp; From
where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.&#8221;&nbsp; Chief Joseph
said this on October 5, 1877 at Bear Paw Mountain.<p><br>
