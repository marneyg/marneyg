think the Sioux, a hard working tribe on the North American plains once had
as many as 30,000 Native Americans. They occupied most of the North Great
Plains and western prairies mainly in Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, North and
South Dakota and up into the bordering provinces of Canada. The Tetons, with
some 15,000 men, women, and children, were the most populous of the seven
tribes. The Oglala Sioux, the largest group of the Tetons numbered some 3,000.
The Sioux nations had a typical Plains culture involving buffalo hunting
and the sun dance.</big><br>

Bull and Crazy Horse. Both did very great deeds for the Sioux nations. Sitting
Bull born in ca. 1834 in the Grand River Valley (Now South Dakota). Sitting
Bull or Tatanka Yotanka, got recognition fro being a warrior and a man of
vision. He joined in on with the usual tribal raids and raids for horses
against enemies such as the Crow and Assiniboin. Many of Sitting Bull&#8217;s followers
believed that his magical powers had brought them victory. He was the leader
in the battle of the Little Big Horn. When Custer was killed on June 25,
1876, Sitting Bull and some of his followers fled to Canada. Then returned
in 1881 on a promise of a pardon. In 1890, Sitting Bull was killed by Native
American police for resisting arrest. He was buried in North Dakota but in
1954 his remains were removed to South Dakota.</span></big><br>

American chief, Crazy Horse of the Oglala Sioux was a prominent leader in
the Sioux resistance to the encroachment of whites in mineral-rich Black
Hills. When he and his people said &#8220;no&#8221; to go on a reservation, troops attacked
them at their camp on the Powder River. Although he was victorious in that
battle he also held victory against Gen. George Crook on the Rosebud River.
Crazy Horse ganged up with Sitting Bull and Gall in defeating Custer at the
Little Big Horn.&nbsp; January of 1877, Gen. Nelson A. Miles attacked his
camp and Crazy Horse with his followers spent the remainder of the winter
near starvation. The group numbering about 1,000 surrendered to the Red Cloud
Agency in May. Imprisoned because of a rumor that he was planning a revolt,
Crazy Horse was stabbed to death with a bayonet while attempting to escape.
His bravery and skill were generally acknowledged and the Sioux remember
him as their great leader. </big><br>

the Indians were using bow and arrows, tomahawks, knives, lances, and war
clubs. They used these before they had any access to muskets or other firearms.
A war club was a length of wood with a knob at the end. Tribes across America
differed in how they made it with material, shape, and decoration. Clubs
then developed into tomahawks, a hatchet shaped weapon that was mainly of
stone. Because of its war symbolism, the tomahawk was buried to represent
peace and dug up for war.</big><br>
