To conclude, on November 29, 1864, under the command of Colonel John W. Chivington,
a former Methodist preacher with political ambitions, his troops destroyed
the Cheyenne camp of Chief Black Kettle and Chief White Antelope at Sand Creek
in eastern Colorado, on the plains. Black Kettle raised his American flag
and his white flag to make sure they new it wasn&#8217;t just any souvenir. The
year before he was given a 34 star flag, saying no one would shoot or open
fire at anyone under the stars and stripes. The commissioner of Indian Affairs,
Colonel Greenwood, in Washington, gave it. When Black Kettle would stay in
one place for a long time, he would put the flag on his tipi, which was in
the middle of the camp. He thought he was at peace with the whites when he
did this with the flag. They were under the force of Fort Lyon. So Black
Kettle told his people not to be afraid of the soldiers opened fire on both
sides of their camp. They were shooting directly into the crowd around Black
Kettle and making them scatter. Somehow he survived and escaped harm at that
Sand Creek Massacre, and he even had returned to save his injured wife. But
Black Kettle had watched 105 of his women and children and 28 of his old
men killed and cut horribly underneath the flag he had raised.<br>

      <td valign="top">Speech: &#8220;The Great Father above hears us, and the Great
Father at Washington will hear what we say. Is it true that you come here
from Washington, and is it true what you say here today? The Big Chief he
gave his words to me to come and meet you here, and I take hold and retain
what he says. Believe all to be true, and think it is all true. Their young
white men, when I meet them on the plains, I give them my horse and my moccasins,
and I am glad today to think that the Great Father has sent good men to take
pity on us. Your young soldiers I don&#8217;t think they listen to you. You bring
presents, and when I come to get them I am afraid they will strike me before
I get away. When I come in to receive presents I take them up crying. Although
wrongs have been done me, I live in hopes. I call them into the lodge and
talk with them; they listen to me and mind what I say. Now we are again together
to make peace. My shame is as big as the earth, although I will do what my
friends advise me to do. I once thought that I was the only man that preserved
to be the friend of the white man, but since they have come and cleaned out
our lodges, horses, and everything else, it is hard for me to believe white
men anymore. Here we are together, Arapahos and Cheyenne, but few of us, we
are one people. As soon as you arrived you started runners after the Arapahos,
with words that I took hold of immediately on hearing them and us. From what
I can see around me. I feel confident that our Great Father has taken pity
on me, and I feel that it is the truth all that has been told me today. All
my friends the Indians that are holding back they are afraid to come in; are
afraid they will be betrayed as I have been. I am not afraid of white men,
but come and take you by the hand, and am glad to have an opportunity of
so doing. These lands that you propose to give us I know nothing about.&nbsp;
There is but a handful here now of the Cheyenne nation, and I would rather
defer making any permanent treaty until the others come. We are living friendly
now. There are a great many white men. Possibly you may be looking for someone
with a strong heart. Possibly you may be intending to do something for me
better than I know of. As my Great Father has sent you here to take us by
the hand, why is it that we are prevented from crossing the Arkansas? If we
give you our hands in peace, we give them also to those of the plains. We
want the privilege of crossing the Arkansas to kill buffalo. I have but few
men here, but what I say to them they listen, and they will abide by their
promise whatever it may be. All these young soldiers are taking us by the
hand, and I hope it will come back good times as formerly. It is very hard
to have one half of our nation absent at this time; we wish to get through
at once. My friends, I want you to understand that I have sent up north for
my people, and I want the road open for them to get here. I hope that which
you have said will be just as you have told me, and I am glad to hear such
good council from you. When my friends get down from north I think it will
be the best time to talk about the lands. There are so few here it would not
look right to make a treaty for the whole nation, and so many absent. I hope
you will use your influence with the troops to pen a road for my men to get
here. You may mark out the lands you propose giving us, but I know nothing
about them; it is a new country to me. I have been in great hopes that I
may see my children that were taken prisoners last fall, and when I get here
I do not see them. I feel disappointed. My young men here, and friends, when
we meet in council and come to the conclusion, it is the truth, we do not
vary from it. This lady&#8217;s husband (Mrs. Wilmarth) Major Fitpatrick, when
he was our agent and brought us presents he did not take them into forts and
house, but would drive his wagons into our villages and empty them there.
Everyone would help him or herself and feel good. He has gone ahead of us,
and he told us that when he was gone we would have trouble, and it has proved
true. We are sorry. But since the death of Major Fitzpatrick we have had many
agents. I don&#8217;t know as we have been wronged, but it looks so. The amount
of good has dimisnished; it doesn&#8217;t look right. Has known Colonel Leavenworth
for sometime; he has treated me well; whether it will continue or not I do
not know. He has got a strong heart, and has done us a great deal of good.
Now that times are so uncertain in this country I would like to have my old
friend Colonel Bent with me. This young man, Charles Wrath, does not get tired.
He is always ready to go and meet them and give them whatever news he has
to send to them. There maybe wrongs done, but we want to show who does these
wrongs before you censure us. I feel that the Great Father has taken pity
on us, and that ever since we have met Colonel Leavenworth&#8217;s words have been
true, and nothing done since that time but what is true, I heard that some
chiefs were sent here to see us. We have brought our women and children,
and how we want to see if you are going to have pity on us.&#8221;<br>
