The Potawatomi Indians were a tribe separated into several bands, until they
were forced on to a reservation in Kansas, in the mid 1800s.&nbsp; They survived
as foragers, hunters, gathers, fishermen, and as farmers.&nbsp; They have
been moved from area to area in the United States, which in time has caused
them to be all these things.</font></td>

The Potawatomi were not always known as the Potawatomi, though out their existence
they have had a few different names. At first, they were known as the Neshnabek,
translated means &#8220;The People.&#8221;</font></td>

There are a few different views of how they became known as the Potawatomi,
which came from the Ojibwe word &#8220;Potawatmink&#8221; which means&nbsp; &#8220;People of
the Place of Fire.&#8221;</font></td>

Another more interesting way they got the name is that the first time they
met a white man, Jean Nicolet, asked his Indian translator &#8220; Who are these
people?&#8221; There was a mistake by the translator who thought that Jean Nicolet
said, &#8220;What are these people doing?&#8221;&nbsp; So he answered &#8220;They are making
fire&#8221; which in Ojibwe sounds like &#8220; Pouutouatomi&#8221; which really means nothing
at all.</font></td>

The population for the Potawatomi was around 8,ooo.&nbsp; That was before
the 30 years of war, white man disease, reservations, and being relocated
by the white people wanting their land.&nbsp; After all that the French believed
that there were only around 4,000 left, considering they all lived in a few
villages around each other they figured that was a good estimate.</font></td>

The only time they were really sure about the population of the Potawatomi
was when they were moved onto a reservation in Kansas.&nbsp; The Indian Bureau
counted 3,400 on the reservation, there were some that left the reservation
for Canada, and there were 600&nbsp; &#8220;Strolling Potawatomi.&#8221;</font></td>

The Potawatomi started off living on the north banks of Lake Huron and Superior.&nbsp;
Losing their trade with the French to the Ontario tribes, they started moving
to the west side of Lake Michigan.&nbsp; This was finished by the 1650s.&nbsp;
moving again, after the Iroquois beat the French allies and moved into southern
Michigan.&nbsp; In 1716, a lot of the Potawatomi&#8217;s were living between Milwaukee
and Detroit.</font></td>

In the 1800s as the whites started moving into the Indian territory, the Potawatomi
had to start moving and selling land in treaties that caused them to lose
a lot of land and not get much money in return.&nbsp; Between the years of
1834 and 1842 most of the Potawatomi were moved on to a reservation in Kansas.</font></td>

The Potawatomi, while living to far north to have good farm land or good
seasons for farming they depended on finding or killing all of their food.&nbsp;
They were good at hunting, fishing, or finding what plant life they needed.&nbsp;
Most of their diet consisted of wild animals, fish, wild rice, red oak acorns,
and maple syrup.</font></td>

After the Beaver Wars, the Potawatomi were moved to Wisconsin&nbsp;&nbsp;
where they learned to farm corn, beans, and squash.&nbsp; Although they had
farming in their lives the men still hunted and were the warriors, and the
women were still the gathers.</font></td>

      <td valign="top"><font size="+1"><br>
As the Potawatomi became more agricultural they started living in one place
for longer amounts of time.&nbsp; They started living more like the white
man, in ways like building log cabins and staying in one area for longer,
but they still made their long winter hunt.</font></td>

The Potawatomi&#8217;s interaction with the FrenchWhen the Potawatomi first saw
the French they called them &#8220;Hairy Faces&#8221; and thought them to be &#8220;Supernatural
Creatures.&#8221;&nbsp; Soon afterward they found out that they were just another
type of person. <br>
As more and more of the French men came and spent all their time with other
men they got lonely and wanted wives and children.&nbsp; Considering that
there were no French women in that part of the country and would not be for
a while the traders turned to marrying the Potawatomi women.&nbsp; Thinking
that this was a good idea the Indians started setting up marriages with the
females in the clan.&nbsp; However this was not as good of a plan it had
seemed.&nbsp; The children of these marriages were the ones who paid the
price; they could not inherit the family&#8217;s clan, and were looked at by the
French as &#8220;Half-Bloods&#8221; and were not accepted.</font></td>
