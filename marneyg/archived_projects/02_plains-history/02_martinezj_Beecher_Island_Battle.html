Frontier.&nbsp; Everywhere on the great plains the Sioux and Cheyenne war
parties were intent on ransacking the villages, settlements, and individual
ranches.&nbsp; They had also been destroying telegraph wires and attacking
wagon trains which led to the Battle of Beecher Island.<br>

been sent to attack but always had arrived after the Indians left.&nbsp; The
Indians hit and run strategies, superb horsemanship, and ability to vanish
quickly off into the wide-open spaces of the plains made them very difficult
to fight.&nbsp; They were very different than the Confederates they had been
used to fighting.<br>

Fort Wallace, Kansas.&nbsp; Each man had been lightly equipped and hand carried
Spencer repeating Rifles with 140 rounds of ammunition and a Colt Army Revolver
with 30 rounds of ammunition. After Forsyth had got his group of fifty men
formed they started their march.</td>

saddling up all the horses, and cleaning and loading all the guns when down
came about ten Indians screaming and yelling Indian chants in an attempt
to startle the Whites horses so that they would be out on the plains by themselves
and it would be easier to attack for the Indians. But when the Indians had
gotten there they got a surprise. They found all the frontiersmen with their
rifles loaded and ready to go.&nbsp; The Indians had then quickly ran back
out of the scouts bullet range.<br>

shouted, &#8220;look at the Indians!&#8221; the hills on both sides had been covered by
hundreds of Indians. None of the scouts had ever seen so many Indians.&nbsp;
Forsyth had seen a small sandbar just a little ways away in the middle of
the river, it was the only cover they had anywhere in the valley.&nbsp; At
Forsyth&#8217;s word all the scouts made a frantic escape under the hail of bullets
and arrows to the small island. All the men tied their horses to a willow
bush and started digging rifle pits with whatever they could find, some men
even killed their horses for cover.&nbsp; This had been a huge move to the
Indians. They had expected to devour the whites in a snap.<br>

Lieutenant Forsyth had his leg broken by an Indian bullet and the second man
in command lieutenant Fredrick H. Beecher, the nephew of Henry Ward Beecher.

it up himself.<br>

      <td valign="top">At about noon that day there was another great gathering
of Indians up on the hills above. Riders came in from every direction. Among
them was a very recognizable warrior, Roman Nose, the tallest of the group.&nbsp;
Standing over six feet tall he was one of the tallest men on the plains and
he was also one of the greatest chiefs ever. The whites could easily tell
now that there was a big plan underway.&nbsp; The group had broken up and
the plan had appeared. Roman Nose had led a body of young men out onto the
valley, others joined in also. They had drawn a line facing the island with
roman nose at the head. The plan was now clear.<br>

straight at the island, while the rest of the warriors were going to creep
up through the grass and fire as fast as possible at the scouts in their sand
pits to distract their attention. When Roman Nose gave his word him and his
horsemen charged straight at the island. Forsyth ordered his men not to shoot
until they had reached the rivers edge. <br>

each time.<br>

horses. Just at the rivers edge the rifles from the scouts jumped up out
of the sand its and started firing at Forsyth&#8217;s word, and groups of riders
fell. On came another charge and more Indians fell. With a good aim and terrible
effect Roman Nose was shot dead and the Indian line broke and scattered. They
had now stopped the charges. Starvation was there plan now. The Indians had
stopped the pack meals with all their belongings on it too. The scouts only
had river water and horse meat to eat and drink now. The whites had made
a couple attempts to sneak to a railroad line hundreds of miles away to give
word for help. One attempt failed because the Indians were too watchful but
a later was successful and they had gotten two men past the Indians. The
people on the island did not know if the men had made it or not. They only
had the river water and horse rotten horse meat for days. The disgusting smell
of the dead roamed the air with bugs everywhere all over the dead while the
Indians where up on the hill looking for runaways.<br>

a dark patch far off in the hills that began to get bigger and bigger as it
came closer in sight.&nbsp; As it came in sight, they noticed it was a few
wagon ambulances and a large column of Calvary men, Indians became scared
and fled the area and the whites were finally rescued, the starving and wounded

battle ever fought between the whites and the plains Indians. The Indians
had lost nearly 100 men, including the great chief Roman Nose.<br>
