and claimed it was on his property. When the discovery became public in 1859,
prospectors rushed to the area. One big problem was the sticky blue ooze
that stuck to picks and shovels. When they got rid of the ooze they found
rich silver ore worth over $2,000 a ton. As more and more people rushed to
the town it grew into a city, and the most important settlement between Denver
and San Francisco. At its peak over 10,000 miners worked in the Comstock
Lode.</td>

longest telegraph in history was sent. It took 12 hours to type and it cost

John W. Mackay, who was Irish born, heard about the Comstock and then walked
250 miles from San Francisco to Virginia City, Nevada. After three years of
working, he heard about a lucrative claim with and old partner. He left his
site and tracked down the partner who was fighting for the Confederate states,
and bought his share for $500 on a battlefield. Then, he returned to Virginia
City and became one of the richest mine owners on the Comstock.</td>

George Hearst was the founder of the news tycoon and was among the first wave
of people to come and look for gold. He had been working unsuccessfully in
California since 1850. He came to the Comstock in 1859, bought a mine for
$3,000, went back to California to get the money, and brought some workers
back and started digging. Trying to get done before winter, they were able
to get out 38 tons of good ore in two months. They then loaded it onto some
mules and dragged it over a mountain pass to a San Francisco smelter where
they got over $90,000 in profit.</td>

Dan DeQuille worked for the Territorial Enterprise during the development
of the Comstock Lode. As a reporter, DeQuille wrote many stories about the
mines of Virginia City during the 1850&#8217;s through the late 1870&#8217;s. He was thought
of as an expert on mining. All his knowledge of these mines was published
in the Enterprise. During the rush on the Comstock the Enterprise had to hire
another reporter, Mark Twain, to keep up. In 1876 DeQuille decided to write
about the history of Virginia City. The book was called &#8220;The Big Bonanza&#8221;
the history of the Comstock Lode.<br>

After getting complaints about the dark streets, gaslights were ordered. The
Commonwealth was the name of the ship sent to give Virginia City the equipment
needed to create a gas plant. A confederate raider ship, the Alabama raided
the Commonwealth and took the equipment. But soon after the ship was raided
the new gas making equipment arrived. Virginia City was now light. The gas
company made the gas from coke. Michael Welch was the town&#8217;s official lamplighter.
