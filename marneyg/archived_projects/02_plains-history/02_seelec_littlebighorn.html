Little Bighorn River and some trees but the scouts (some being Indians) knew

seconds the rest of his men fired.&nbsp; This caught the Indians totally off
guard and many started to flee but recognizing the situation, Sitting Bull
quickly got the men together and in no time they had formed a well enough
unit to make a counter attack.&nbsp; Within ten minutes of the first shot
Reno ordered his men to fall back and form a skirmish line but the Indians
were coming out in huge numbers and eventually the skirmish line fell into
a full blown retreat.&nbsp; Reno and what was left of his men ran for a about

Reno and Benteen were shooting Custer had just found out how big the village
was and waiting for Benteen and his men to come but they were helping Reno
fight.&nbsp; After a while he decided to go down and fight the village.&nbsp;
Along the way he had to Custer had to go down the bluffs then go across a
river and down a ravine, which slowed them down a lot.&nbsp; By then an Indian
scout had recognized Custer and his men so the Indians stopped going to Reno
and Benteen, which took pressure off them.&nbsp; Custer got as far as the
middle of the village when he was forced to retreat and back up to the ridge
but this time Crazy Horse had arrived and had come up behind them making their
escape was slim and none with Indians shooting guns and arrows while jumping
out of hiding places and knocking men off their horses.&nbsp; Somehow Custer
and some of his men made it past all this and were ready to retreat but Gall
and his warriors had seen Custer and his men retreat and knew where he was
going.&nbsp; At this point he turned to his remaining scouts and said &#8220;You
have done what you agreed to do &#8211; brought us to the Sioux camp; now go back
to the pack train and live&#8221; which some did but a few loyal scouts stayed
to fight.&nbsp; By now the men were ordered to shoot their horses and stack
the carcasses on top of each other to stop bullets and arrows, but it didn&#8217;t
work with bullets and by now all the soldiers were dead.&nbsp; The fighting
continued for a day with Benteen and Reno.&nbsp; By then Terry had arrived
and when the Indians saw his force they fled.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></big></td>

of the war lead to the capture of Crazy Horse when he surrendered.&nbsp; He
was bayoneted in the back by a soldier while resisting arrest and died.&nbsp;
Sitting Bull fled to Canada to escape arrest and became a follower of the
Ghost Dance.&nbsp; He was shot outside his home while being arrested by his

example, supposedly the Indians had better guns probably because they stole
them from people the killed and if Custer would've stayed in one big colum
they would've had a better chance of beating them but the chances are they
still would've because it was 260 soldiers and about 2000 Indians. &nbsp;
We treated the Indians not as well as we should've. &nbsp;A soldier memorial
was up in the late 1870's to remember the soldiers who died but an Indian
memorial was not put up until 1991. &nbsp;Last year we did a website about
the Holocaust and there isn't much difference to the way the jews and Indians
were treated.</big></td>
