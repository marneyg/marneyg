Quanah and Pecos. She got so depressed from being separated from her Indian
family that she starved herself to death just shortly after Prairie Flower,

in the year 1860.<br>

Quanah became a great horseman and proved himself to be an able leader. These
characteristics were in demand when, as a result of their not signing the
Medicine Lodge Treaty or move to a reservation provided by the treaty, the
Quhadis became fugitives on the plains. They continued to hunt buffalo in
their traditional way while still raiding settlements. For the next seven
years the Quhadis held the Texas plains without being touched. Attempts of
the Fourth United States Calvary under Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie to find the
Indians in 1871 and 1872 failed. The army was unable to find the Indians
and the troopers lost a number of horses on October 9, 1871, when Quanah
and his followers raided their campsite and stole their horses. Mackenzie
gave up the search in mid-1872.<br>

Adobe Walls. The Indians thought the raid was a disaster; their planned surprise
was messed up, the hunters great weapons made them unable to fend off repeated
attacks. In the end the hunters suffered only one casualty, while the Indians
had fifteen dead and several wounded, including Quanah.&nbsp; So the Indians

agents even named Quanah Parker chief of the reservation because they were

Theodore Roosevelt as one of his friends. Magazine reporters, on subjects

the Peyote Eating native American Church. Peyote is a drug that was thought
