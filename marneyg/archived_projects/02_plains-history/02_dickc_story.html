      <td valign="top"><big><big>&nbsp; </big>Fredrick Remington was a great
illustrator of his time. He is best remembered for his paintings and sculptures
of the American West. Frederick Remington was born in Canton, New York in
1861.&nbsp; His father was Seth Pierre who was a prosperous newspaper publisher
and a person who had served during the Civil War as a lieutenant colonel of
the cavalry.&nbsp; His mother was Clara Sackrider.&nbsp; He inherited things
from his father like an interest in military and cavalry operations.&nbsp;
One thing he did not inherit from him was his trim figure.&nbsp; Remington
had no trim figure, but instead was 5ft. 9inch. tall and weighed well around
300 lbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></td>

    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><big>&nbsp; He went through Highland Military Academy
in Worchester, Massachusetts where he attended for his high school years.&nbsp;
He didn&#8217;t grow up in any particular town, but in a wilderness region.&nbsp;
He became an avid hunter and horseman.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t care much for academic
studies and had modest artistic abilities. He spent his free time drawing
pictures.&nbsp; After struggling through public, military, and private schools,
he elected to enter the School of Arts at Yale in 1878.&nbsp; He had excelled
more in sports, than in painting. He excelled in football under the captaincy
of Walter Camp at the age of sixteen.&nbsp; Remington received sound technical
training, but the work of his was uninspired, and he acquired a lasting distaste
for academic art.</big></td>

to the west in 1881 after his father died in 1880.&nbsp; He tried to ranch
in Kansas, but failed and had to sell a western sketch to Harper&#8217;s Weekly
in 1886.&nbsp; Harper&#8217;s Weekly printed the first cartoon he had illustrated
in 1882.&nbsp; Since they already knew how he drew, he was considered one
of the premier illustrators of that time.&nbsp; His favorite subjects to draw
were horses, but he also drew Indians, soldiers, and cowboys.&nbsp; In Kansas
he invested in a salon and a hardware store.&nbsp; Remington also learned
the arts of handling a six-gun and a lariat.&nbsp; During the Spanish-American
War he worked under William Randolph Hearst as a war correspondent for the
New York Journal.&nbsp; In 1895 Remington revealed the &#8220;Bronco Buster&#8221;. It
was Remington&#8217;s best-known bronze sculpture. He was then inspired to cast
24 other statues representing the frontier.&nbsp; He also established a studio
for the Art Students League.&nbsp; Remington found the west exhilarating and
knew it contained very fascinating inhabitants. <br>

and was successful in winning the hand of his bride, Eva Caton. Then he went
to Kansas City where he gained a long needed stability by her presence.&nbsp;
In 1885 he rode west into the Arizona Territory in search of more material

the U.S. Cavalry against Geronimo&#8217;s Apaches, which was getting much attention.<br>

he had considerable experience in the elusiveness of the Native Americans
who were on the run and the tenacity of Calvary men in pursuit. Remington&#8217;s
portfolio was bulging and he returned to New York and discovered the editor
of Outing Magazine. It was Poultney Bigelow, his fellow student at Yale. His
troubles were over. Remington&#8217;s work began appearing regularly in their journal.&nbsp;
By January 1886 Remington had developed a very complex attitude toward the
Native Americans. In the course of repeated returns to the West, he found
admiration for the primitive people. While his fame grew, he found his work
in sudden demand. He began receiving requests for book illustrations. He
had one published in the Century Magazine of Roosevelt&#8217;s &#8220;Ranch life&#8221; and
