One summer in the year 1853, there was a young Cheyenne soldier named Tall
Bull.<br>
By 1864 this young soldier had grown to become one of the greatest Cheyenne
leaders. He had become a well-acknowledged leader of the Dog Soldiers, the
fiercest of the Cheyenne warrior societies. More than 100 lodges, or about
500 people followed him and the other chiefs over eastern Colorado and western
Kansas and Nebraska.</td>

Late that year the Sand Creek Massacre set off a war with the whites, the
so-called Cheyenne-Arapaho War of 1864-65. Tall Bull, seeing the war&#8217;s futility,
led his people north, away from the white men to the Powder River country.
But within a year, homesickness had driven them back to the Republican and
Smoke Hill River area.</td>

In the spring of 1866, Tall Bull and his followers returned to a strange
land. The buffalo were drifting out of the prime lands along the Smoky Hills,
moving away from the advancing farms and railroads. Suffering depredations
at the hands of white settlers and seeing the buffalo disappearing, the Dog
Soldiers began a war once again. Through the winter and into the spring of
1867 they raided the central stage route, determined to drive the wagons
and stations off the buffalo range.</td>

you there than here. I have said all I want to say.&#8221; Tall Bull maintained
the peace by stopping the Dog Soldiers from attacking the troops as they
approached their village and also by restraining the great warrior Roman

Traveling north through eastern Colorado Territory, Tall Bull led his people
towards the Republican again trying to find the bands that had not gone south
for the winter. While Tall Bull&#8217;s people camped near Beaver Creek, the 5th
Cavalry, under Major Eugene Carr, attacked them. A long, tiring fight ensured
over many miles and with many skirmishes. The village lost many provisions
and lodges. In retaliation, Tall Bull led his warriors to the Smoky Hill,
where they killed, looted, burned and kidnapped when he had started his anger
and his need for provisions, he retreated once again into the rough and isolated
country between the Republican and the Platte determined to take his people
north once again, as he had in 1865, to five free with their northern relatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

Kettle reflected on the bloody summer, which had witnessed terror and murder
across the plains. Roving bands of young Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors had
raided eastern Colorado and western Kansas, causing alarm and rage with the
white settlers. Finally, Territorial Governor, John Evans called for a military
militia to end the Indian problem. Governor Evans ordered all Cheyenne&#8217;s

He knew from experience this new militia would set out on a full-scale war
and would not relent, even to the peace-seeking Black Kettle and his Cheyenne
people. Among the Indian tribes of the plains, Black Kettle was widely respected
as a fierce adversary of the Pawnee and Kiowa, yet he believed in peace with
the whites.<br>
In 1861 he had signed the peace treaty at Fort Wise, promising to remain
in the vicinity, of the Arkansas River and not to interfere with the emigrants
along the Smoky Hill Trail. In 1863,he and Lean Bear had traveled to Washington,
D.C. to see the &#8220;Great White Father,&#8221; President Abraham Lincoln, It quite
possibly could have been during this visit that Black Kettle realized the
great magnitude of the white population and realized that all-out warfare
with the white man would mean the annihilation of his own people.</td>

For the next three days, Black Kettle&#8217;s people were not only facing a surge
of miners, also an increasing number of homesteaders on the plains as promoter,
William N. Byers and his Rocky Mountain News helped to bring agricultural
development to the Colorado Territory. The young Cheyenne warriors refused
to obey the Treaty of Fort Wise and launched raids among the white people,
running off livestock, disabling mail routes and destroying freight carriers,
causing major supply shortages in Denver and elsewhere.</td>

Black Kettle responded to the governor&#8217;s demands at Fort Lyon, Major Scott
J. Anthony instructed Black Kettle to move his people to Sand Creek, some
40 miles from the fort. Anthony told Black Kettle his people would be safe
and the game would be plentiful. Anthony even presented a white flag to Black
Kettle, a sign of his intentions to protect the Indians.<br>
Later that week, Chivington, Governor Evans, and Major Anthony planed an
attack on Black Kettle and his people. The attack came at dawn. &#8220;Take no
prisoners,&#8221; Chivington ordered; adding his own slogan, &#8220;nits make lice.&#8221;
The attack lasted over 8 hours, becoming one of the worst acts of savagery
that exists in records of Colorado history. Black Kettle escape across the
prairie along with 500 others. Black Kettle&nbsp;immediately flew the flags
given to him by Major Anthony. Black Kettle took his wife and ran. He later
extracted the bullets, and his wife lived. &#8220;All Cheyenne chiefs, Black Kettle,
White Antelope, Little Robe, Left Hand, Knock Knee, and One Eye were killed.
In 1867 he signed the Treaty of Medicine Lodge. Promising peace, the Indians
gave up their land along the Arkansas River, in exchange receiving land on
the Indian Reservation in today&#8217;s Oklahoma. The army and the government did
not keep promises with the Indians as you can clearly see here. </td>

peace, that we may not be mistaken by them for enemies. I have not come here
with a little wolf bark, but have come to talk plain with you.&#8221; Black Kettle

object to, but say yes to it &#8230; the white people can go wherever they please

Roman Nose. He had fierce-proud face of a Hawk, and his deeds were legendary.
