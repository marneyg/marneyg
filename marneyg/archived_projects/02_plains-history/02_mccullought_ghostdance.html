the Indian movement, hunger, disease, and poverty started to destroy the Indians
culture and will to survive. With all these terrible things eating away at
the Indian culture, a Paiute named Wovoka (son of Tavibo, whose teachings
helped start the Ghost Dance) had a vision that Christ would come again and
was warned of the white man&#8217;s evils, which all happen during an eclipse of
the sun. Walitawin, who was said to be the Virgin Mary, best described the
purpose of the Ghost Dance when she said, &#8221;The is to belong solely to his
(Christ) chosen people, and this continent is to be extended much further
west, taking a part of the great sunset water. The eastern part of the continent
will be abandoned, all but in the western part where of herds of buffalo will
wander as in days long ago, and with the disappearance of all the Indians
who now sleep, and forever more they wander over the earth with no one to
say: &#8216;Do this or I will put you in the guard house&#8217;&#8221;, which is similar to
all other theories of the recreation of earth in the religion of the Ghost
Dance.</td>

      <td valign="top">After several months of its creation, the Ghost Dance
had spread through the Indians and their tribes like a wild fire. From just
the Paiute tribe, it jumped to the Sioux, Arapaho, Iroquois, Utes, Bannocks,
and the Shoshone within, practically, a blink of an eye. Short Bull, Kicking
Bear, And Good Thunder were just a few chiefs of the Ghost Dance religion,
called this by the white man because of the religions purpose to resurrect
an reunite with the dead.</td>

      <td valign="top">With the number of Ghost Dance followers increasing
at an alarming rate, the government, fearing an uprising in the Indians, went
out stop the Ghost Dance in its tracks (about this time, chief Si Tanka and
a band of Mineconjou Sioux started to get into the Ghost Dance). Late in
the year 1890, the government, thinking Sitting Bull was the heart of the
Ghost Dance, sent officers to arrest him. Only a few months after starting
to follow the Ghost Dance, Sitting Bull, who already knew he was going to
be taken away, was surrounded while asleep in his cabin and was told he was
going to jail. Not wanting any trouble, he asked if his horse could be settled
while he dressed. While Sitting Bull was dressing, a group of his followers,
which was also into the Ghost Dance, gathered and out numbered the officers
and they started to try to keep their leader from going to jail. While all
the commotion was going on, a follower of Sitting Bull&#8217;s pulled out a rifle
a shot at the officers. At end of the fight, Sitting Bull had been shot in
the head twice and had died.</td>

      <td valign="top">After the death of Sitting Bull, Chief Si Tanka (also
Known as Spotted Elk and Big Foot) and his followers started on his way to
complain to the government when he was join by about 80 Lakota Sioux right
before they past Wounded Knee. The government, thinking Chief Si Tanka was
hostile, sent soldiers to intercept them. The soldiers change up with Tanka
and told them to go to Wounded Knee. Tanka and his followers listened, and
where then in circled when they reached Wounded Knee. Tanka and his people
started to be unarmed, when all of a sudden, a blind Indian was started to
struggle to keep his rifle when it accidentally fired. The soldiers then open
fire with rifles and cannons upon the unarmed men, women, and children, killing
many innocence people at Wounded Knee Massacre. General E.D. Scott had this
to say about this massacre, &#8221;There is nothing to conceal or apologize for
in the Wounded Knee Battle &#8211; beyond the killing of a wounded buck by a hysterical
recruit. The firing was begun by the Indians and continued until they stopped
- with the one exception noted above." Scott also stated," That the women
and children were casualties was un fortunate but unaviodable, and most must
have been killed by Indian bullets...The Indians at Wounded Knee brought
their own destruction as surely as any people ever did. Their attack on the
troops was as treacherous as any in the history of history of Indian warfare,
and that they were under astrange religious hallucination is only an explanation
notan excuse."<br>

dance for what they believed in. According to James Mooney, who had witnessed,
photographed, and written in detail what the dance was like, the Ghost Dance
starts sometime around the afternoon &nbsp;or later, after sundown. If it
begins early in the afternoon, they would break for supper. Plus, the painting
and dressing before the dance usually takes about two hours. In his notes,
