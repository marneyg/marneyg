William Cody was a Pony Express rider, buffalo hunter, Indian fighter, army
scout, and an international showman.&nbsp; In his lifetime Cody was a living
example of rugged Americanism.<br>

Cody was known as the best Buffalo hunter on the Great Plains there ever was.&nbsp;
So the Grand Duke Alexis of Russia at age nineteen came to ask Buffalo Bill
to take him on a buffalo hunt in 1872.&nbsp; It was planned that Cody would
lead the wagon train.&nbsp; Buffalo Bill Cody knew several famous Indians
and convinced a famous Sioux Indian named Spotted Tail and his followers
to join in the hunt.&nbsp; When explained to Spotted Tail about the hunting
expedition he said, &#8217;&#8217;Great White man wants a big hunt with the Indians.&#8217;&#8217;
Cody Also asked the Indians to entertain the Duke.&nbsp; They agreed and
the Duke had a great time especially when they went on a crazy stagecoach
ride behind six wild horses with Cody holding the reins.<br>
