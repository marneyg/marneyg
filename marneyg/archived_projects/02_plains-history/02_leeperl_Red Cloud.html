a great horseman.&nbsp; When Red Cloud was six years old his father gave him
a spirited colt, and said to him: &#8220;My son, when you are able to sit on the
back of this colt quietly without saddle or bridle, I shall be proud that
you can win a wild creature and learn to use it, will as a man to win and
rule men.&#8221;</td>

most other Indian boys would have, he started practicing throwing the lariat.
In a little while he was able to lasso the colt.&nbsp; He was dragged of
his feet one time but managed to hang on.&nbsp; When the older Indians drove
the herd of ponies to water, he drove his colt with the rest.&nbsp; Red Cloud
was always practicing riding his colt all the time.&nbsp; Red Cloud was successful
with hunt because his horses were so broken.&nbsp; He was one of the best
hunter&#8217;s of his tribe.&nbsp; At the age of nine he rode his father&#8217;s his
father&#8217;s horse for the buffalo hunts. He became a very skillful hunter.&nbsp;
His horses were more broken than any other Indians in his tribe.&nbsp; His
horses were a lot faster than the other Indians horses.&nbsp; His hunting
also made him a great warrior.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</td>

war against the U.S. ever fought by an Indian nation.&nbsp; It started when
white settlers began to mine for gold in Lakota territory. The U.S built
forts by the Bozeman Trail.&nbsp; It also went through Lakota land.&nbsp;
White settlers began to walk through Lakota land.Red Cloud&#8217;s first attack
was on Fort Phil Kearny.&nbsp; The tension of the feeling of the invaders
was at its height.&nbsp; There was no voice at the Powder River.&nbsp; Red
Cloud was ignorant of the strength of the white men.</td>

Second Treaty of Fort Laramie.&nbsp; The U.S. promised it would get rid of
the Bozeman Trail.&nbsp; The U.S. gave them part of South Dakota.&nbsp; Although,
Red Cloud&#8217;s son still wanted to fight.&nbsp; The other Indians wanted to
fight for their land too.&nbsp; But Red Cloud still moved to the reservation.&nbsp;
Then he moved to Nebraska as the Red Cloud Agency.&nbsp; In 1898, Red Cloud
lobbied the Indian agent.</td>
