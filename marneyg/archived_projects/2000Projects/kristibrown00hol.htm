Adolf Hitler was born on April 20, 1889 in Austria.&nbsp; As a child Hitler
did very well in school, until he entered Realshule, a secondary school.&nbsp;
At this time, he and his father disagreed about his future career.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the time he was struggling in school, he began to form his political
views: strong sense of German nationalism, the beginning of anti-Semitism,
and a distaste for the ruling family, and political structure of Austria-Hungary.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hitler considered himself to be a first and foremost a German.&nbsp; Another
one of the reasons Hitler developed these views, was the death of his strong
father in 1903.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1907 he traveled to Vienna to try to attempt his dreams of being an
artist.&nbsp; Hitler's mother died in 1907, he decided to stay in Vienna,
instead of going back to his home town.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hitler did not have a steady job while living in Vienna, instead he had
many odd jobs.&nbsp; He lived in a cheap rooming houses or slept on park
benches.&nbsp; He often had to get meals from charity kitchens.&nbsp; While
still in Vienna he learned to dislike non-Germans.&nbsp; He was a German-speaking
Austrian and considered himself a German.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When World War I began, Hitler volunteered for service in the German army.&nbsp;
Although he was decorated twice for bravery, he only got to the rank of
corporal.&nbsp; Hitler was in the recovering from temporary blindness,
maybe caused by a poison gas attack, when World War I ended.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1920, Hitler joined the National Socialist German Working Party, also
known as Nazis.&nbsp; He organized an army for the Nazi party called the
"Storm Troopers" or Brown Shirts.&nbsp; The were asked to fight groups
wanting to break-up the Nazi rallies.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On November 9, 1923, hitler led 2,000 Storm troopers to seize the Bavarian
government.&nbsp; He failed and was arrested and put in jail.&nbsp; While
in jail he wrote Mein Kampf.&nbsp; He only served 9 months in prison, and
as soon as he was released he began to rebuild the party again.&nbsp; By
1929, the Nazis had become an important minor political party.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1930, a worldwide depression hit Germany.&nbsp; He said that the Jews
and Communists were the cause of the defeat in World War I, so the Germans
shouldn't have to pay for damages.&nbsp; Hitler promised to rid Germany
of Jews and Communists and to reunite the German speaking part of Europe.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On January 30, 1933, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor
of Germany.&nbsp; When von Hindenburg died in 1934, Hitler already had
control of Germany and gave himself the title "Fueher"</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Under Hitler's government, called the Third Reich, there was no place for
freedom.&nbsp; The government controlled everyone's life.&nbsp; Hitler
planed to rid the nation and eventually the world of Jews, Gypsies, Negroes,
handicapped, and mentally ill persons.&nbsp; The plan was called the "Final
Solution."</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
World War II began in 1939 when Hitler invaded Poland.&nbsp; By this time
extermination camps were being built in Germany, Poland, and Russia.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before Hitler was stopped in 1945, by the Allied countries, he had caused
the extermination for over 12 million people.&nbsp; Hitler committed suicide
in his bunker on April 30, 1945 and 7 days later, Germany surrendered.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
