Irish immagrents in the state of New York. By age sixteen soon after taking
a job as a department store clerk, he started his own small business manufacturing
jewelry cases. In his spare time, Brady studied photography under a number
of teachers, including Samuel F. B. Morse, the man who had recently introduced
photography to America. Brady quickly cought on to this new hobby. By 1844,
he had his own photography studio in New York.</font></font></td>

At the peak of his success as a portrait photographer, Brady turned his
attention to the Civil War. Planning to document the war on a grand scale,
he organized a corps of photographers to follow the troops in the field.
Friends tried to discourage him, citing battlefield dangers and financial
risks, but Brady persisted. He later said, "I had to go. A spirit in my
feet said 'Go,' and I went."</font></font></td>

Brady brought the first gory images of the war to the people of American.
Many of the Civil War pictures attributed to Brady were not shot by Brady.
More of a project manager, he spent most of his time supervising his corps
of traveling photographers, preserving their negatives and buying others
from private photographers freshly returned from the battlefield, so that
his collection would be great in all aspects.</font></font></td>

After the Civil War, Brady found that war weary Americans were no longer
interested in purchasing photographs of the recent bloody conflict. Having
risked his fortune on his Civil War enterprise, Brady lost the gamble and
fell into bankruptcy. His negatives were neglected until 1875, when Congress
purchased the entire archive for $25,000. Brady's debts swallowed the entire
sum. He died in 1896, penniless and unappreciated. In his final years,
Brady said, "No one will ever know what I went through to secure those
negatives. The world can never appreciate it. It changed the whole course
of my life."&nbsp;</font></font></td>
