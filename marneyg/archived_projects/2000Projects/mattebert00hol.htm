<td VALIGN=CENTER><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Comic Sans MS">Josef
Mengele was born in Gunzburg, Germany on March 16, 1911.&nbsp; He was the
oldest in the family, with two younger brothers, Karl and Alois.&nbsp;
While growing up, his nickname was "Beppo".&nbsp; In 1926 he was diagnosed
with osteomyelitis.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1931 Mengele joined the Steel Helmuts (Stahlhelm).&nbsp; In October
1934 he left the Steel Helmuts because of his kidney trouble.&nbsp; A year
later Mengele was awarded his Ph.D. from the University of Munich.&nbsp;
On January 1, 1937 he was appointed as a research assistant at the Third
Reich Institute for Heredity, Biology, and Radical purity at the University
of Frankfurt.&nbsp; In May, 1937, Mengele joined the Nazi Party, and a
year later admitted to the SS.&nbsp; During July he was awarded his medical
degree by the University of Frankfurt.&nbsp; Soon after, in October, he
began basic training with the Wehrmacht, which lasted three months.&nbsp;
In July of 1939 Mengele married Irene Schoenbein.&nbsp; A year later he
joined the medical corps of the Waffen SS.&nbsp; In June 1941 he was sent
to the Ukraine as part of the Waffen SS, and received the Iron Cross, Second
Class.&nbsp; In January 1942 Mengele joined the Waffen SS's Viking Division
medical corps.&nbsp; He earned the Iron Cross, First Class, by pulling
two soldiers out of a burning tank while under enemy fire.&nbsp; He also
was awarded the Black Badge for the Wounded and the Medal for the Care
of the German People.&nbsp; After that he was pronounced unfit for duty,
so he volunteered to go to a concentration camp.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On May 30, 1942 Mengele arrived at Auschwitz.&nbsp; While there he conducted
<u><a href="mattebert00hol1.html">medical
experiments</a></u> on twins, dwarfs, giants, and many others.&nbsp; Day
after day he helped with the selection process of the new arrivals.&nbsp;
One day he selected over 400,000 Women to go to the gas chamber.&nbsp;
On March 11, 1944 his son, Rolf, was born.&nbsp; Sometime in the middle
of January 1945 he fled Auschwitz.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mengele was on the run.&nbsp; He arrived at Gross-Rosen camp, and then
left before the Russians liberated it on February 11, 1945.&nbsp; He was
later spotted at Mauthausen.&nbsp; Mengele was captured as a prisoner of
war and held in a POW camp near Munich.&nbsp; He received papers from a
fellow prisoner, Dr. Fritz Ulmann.&nbsp; Mengele, for vanity reasons, hadn't
gotten his blood type tattooed beneath his arm .&nbsp; The American Army
did not realize he was a member of the SS and released him.&nbsp; Mengele
settled at George Fischer's farm for three years.&nbsp; He escaped to Argentina
in 1949.&nbsp; In 1954 his father came to visit him in Argentina. He divorced
Irene the same year.&nbsp; Two years later he officially had his name changed
to Josef Mengele.&nbsp; In 1958 Mengele married his brother, Karl's, widow,
Martha Mengele.&nbsp; On June 7, 1959 West Germany issued its first arrest
warrant for Mengele.&nbsp; He then moved to Paraguay.&nbsp; In 1964 the
Universities of Frankfurt and Munich withdrew his academic degrees.&nbsp;
He was believed to have died on February 7, 1979 on the beach at Bertiogain
Embu, Brazil while suffering a stroke while swimming in the ocean.&nbsp;
In June 1985, the body&nbsp; in the grave was exhumed for forensic identification,
because the body was buried in a grave named Wolfgang Gerhard.</font></font></font></td>
