<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of
Wednesday, July 1st, both armies were relatively spreaded out across the
Pennsylvania country. Although many, including generals, didn’t know it,
the two armies were marching on converging roads leading toward Gettysburg.
General Lee issued orders for his army to concentrate at Cashtown, about
eight miles from Gettysburg. He also issued an order not to bring on any
engagement. General Harvey Heth’s division of A. Hills III was in front
of the rest of the Confederate Army headed toward Gettysburg to get shoes
when John Buford’s division of cavalry was west of town. The Battle of
Gettysburg had begun, and quite by accident.&nbsp;</td>

Friday July 3rd, General Lee ordered Longstreet’s final division, George
Pickett’s, which had arrived too late to take part of the battle of July
2nd, to assault the center of the Potomac’s line on Cemetery Ridge. Pickett’s
division, supported by divisions from the III corps, was repulsed and suffered
sixty casualties. This action ended the Battle of Gettysburg.&nbsp;</td>
