May 8, 1943, a day of desperation, a day of little hope for the Jewish
in the Warsaw ghetto. The day began like so many others with hunger, sickness,
and confusion. Many of the ghetto inhabitants had been preparing for an
uprising. for weeks a group of ghetto youths calling themselves Z.O.B.
(Jewish fighting organization of the Warsaw ghetto) were having meetings
inside of ghetto buildings planning a revolt against the Germans.</font></font>
<p><font color="#CC0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size=+1>The
horror began for the Jewish People on november 16, 1940 when the Germans
sealed the warsaw ghetto. 1/3 of a million Jews lived in the ghetto. The
Jews had no idea that Hitler would later kill them. When the murders started
some still didn't believe it would happen to them&nbsp;</font></font></td>

Many of the people in the ghetto started forming organizations that they
called youth groups later to be known as Z.O.B. This group was the beginning
of the underground resistance movement. One of the leaders of this group
was Yitzhak Zuckerman. In a speech to Jewish followers before the uprising
Zuckerman stated, "The masses did not believe us. There are no arms, and
it seems we will not get any. We have no strength to start anew. The people
are being exterminated. Our honor trampled. This small group can still
save it. Let us go out tomorrow into the streets. let us put fire to the
ghetto and stab the Germans with knives. We will die. It is our duty to
die, and our honor will have been saved. Days will come and it will be
told: This poor nation had youth which saved it's honor as best it could."&nbsp;</font></font></td>

Another Z.O.B leader during the uprising was Mordechai Aniclewicz. Just
before the battle Aniclewicz gave a speech in which he said "The last wish
of my life has been fulfilled. Jewish self defense has become a fact. Jewish
resistance and revenge have become actualities. I am happy to have been
one of the first Jewish fighters in the ghetto.” Anielewicz fell in battle
on May 8, 1943.&nbsp;</font></font>
