<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#C0C0C0"><font size=+2>Despite this
big wording the Emancipation Proclamation, written by Abraham Lincoln was
limited in many ways.&nbsp; It was only for states that had succeeded from
the Union, not paying attention to slavery in the Border States.&nbsp;
It also expressly exempted parts of the Confederacy that had already come
under northerner’s power.&nbsp; Most important the freedom, it promised
upon military victory.&nbsp; Though the Emancipation Proclamation did not
quickly free a single slave.&nbsp; It used basics and changed the character
of the war after January 1, 1863 every advance of the troops expanded the
domain of freedom.&nbsp; Moreover the Proclamation announced the acceptation
of black men into the Union Army and Navy.&nbsp; Making it possible for
the ones that were freed to free others. By the end of the war almost 200,000
black soldiers and sailors had fought for the Union and their freedom.&nbsp;
From the first days of the civil war slaves had acted to help their liberty.&nbsp;
The Emancipation Proclamation confirmed their instance that the war was
fought for freedom.&nbsp; It made moral force to the Union cause and strengthened
the Union both military and politically.&nbsp; As a milestone along the
road to slavery’s final destruction, the Emancipation Proclamation has
assumed a place among the great documents of human freedom.&nbsp; The original
copy of the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 is in the National
Archives in Washington D.C., with the text covering five pages, the document
was origannaly tied with bright red blood red and sky blue ribbons. They
are attached to the signature page by a waffered impression of the United
States seal most of the silk rbbons remains, still parts of the U.S. seal
are disrepairable and some of the color has just warn off.&nbsp; The document
was bound with other documents in other proclamations in a large volume
preserved for many years by the Department of the state.&nbsp; When it
was prepared for binding it was repaired with strips along the centerfold,
them they mounted it on a still large piece of paper.&nbsp; It was written
in red ink, and on the upper right corner of the big sheet is the number
of the Proclamation 95 given to the Proclamation by the department of state
long after it was signed.&nbsp; The other records with the Emancipation
Proclamation was transfered in 1936 from the Department of States to the
National Archives of the United States.&nbsp; Many people go see the Emancipation
Proclamation.&nbsp; They come from all around the world.&nbsp; The Emancipation
Proclamation was and is a huge succes.&nbsp; The Emancipation Proclamation
was a stunning speech by Aberham Lincoln.&nbsp;</font></font></font></td>
