hard to believe that more people died in this little town of Gettysburg
than ever before on American soil. 23,040 Union killed captured, wounded,
or killed; 20,650 to an estimated 28,000 Confederate casualties. It started
with General Robert E. Lee and his Confederate army marching north. To
start battle with the Union and their leader General George C. Meade. Approaching
Gettysburg along Chambersburg Pike, they expected Union minimal resistance.
Fighting went on through the first day until about 11 p.m. when fighting
ceased while both sides waited on reinforcements. Only two more days of
this horrible battle left to fight.</font></font></font></td>

Day two of the great battle presumed from early in the morning. Lee, Confederate
commander, sent General Stuart with four brigades to attempt to swing around
the Union’s right. His intention: to exploit any successes by Confederate
infantry.</font></font></font></td>

Day three, at three p.m. at Rummal’s farm, about three miles east of Gettysburg,
Stuart ran into two brigades commanded by MG McGregg. McGregg’s men held
their place and soon after Lee and his army were forced to retreat through
Hagerstown, Maryland into Virginia. The North took this victory as the
South came to the safety of their homes. This was the turning point in
the war because it was when they determined that all other battles would
be fought on Southern soil.&nbsp;</font></font></font></td>

Imbroden’s wagon train, which consisted of wagons and ambulances, lined
up for seventeen miles. The 51,000-casualty battle was not quiet the end
though, never the less, the war would go on for another two grueling years
after that three-day collision. While Lee went home the North had claimed
victory of one of the greatest battles of the Civil War</font><font color="#FF6666">.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
