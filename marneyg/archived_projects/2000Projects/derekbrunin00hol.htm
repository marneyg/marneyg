<img SRC="../barbwire7macdmb.gif" height=38 width=749>
<br><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During World War II in Germany
their was a lot of resistance. Some resistance was major like shooting
a nazi or little acts like hiding a Jew. The punishment for hiding a Jew
was jail or concentration camp and to hide a jew and lie that you weren't
you would be shot. No matter what kind of resistance it was very risky.
Many people who resisted were killed. Many people gave their lives doing
what was right and that is why I decided to do my report on these unknown
heroes.</font>
<br><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Warsaw ghetto was the first
and largest resistance of the war. Sixty thousand Jews fought with concealed
guns and grenades. Many Jews were driven to the ghettos throughout the
war. Many were starved to death while others beaten and shot. Some committed
suicide rather than be killed by the nazis saying ''I would rather kill
myself than let a nazi get the privilege. The nazi intended for the resistance
to last a few days but it lasted for four weeks. After the Warsaw resistance
many tried to escape through the sewers but many failed and were gunned
down. Many Jews helped the nazis because the they were told their families
wouldn't be harmed. The helping Jew was hated by everyone in the ghetto.
Jews were rounded up and took off the streets no matter what age, height,
or sex to concentration camps from the ghettos and when that time came
the Jewish helpers were treated and took to concentration camps just like
any other Jew. Soldiers would shave rabbi's beards shaved and made everyone's
life as miserable as possible.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After learning of Jews
being educated Adolf Hitler said it was stop immediately but their were
many underground libraries to insure kids got their education. Many Jews
had plans to finish their education after the war was over. Lots of technical
instructions were given in the ghettos so people could learn traits like
woodworking, metal working, and leather tanning. The Jews even set up a
medical center in the Warsaw Ghetto. Jews practiced their religion in their
attics, basements, and any other secret places. The punishment for practicing
their religion which hitler called being "disobedient'' was punishable
by death. Culture in the Ghettos still existed their were orchastras, plays,
and poets. Many Jews used humor to lessen the suffering.</font>
<br><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Eastern Europe many
who escaped from a ghetto or concentration camp had a chance for survival
if they could get to the nearby woods. Although many still died from starvation
and other problems some found small bands of people with guns who were
in the same situation. Most of these groups were thought to be guerrila
like resistance. Lots of Soviet soldiers were caught behind enemy lines
after Hitler's quick advancement in to Poland. The Soviet soldiers to hid
in the woods. These people were called people of the forest.</font>
<br><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The high point for resistance
was after American and British advancements in Normandy. Bombs were detonated
on depots to delay supplies to German Soldiers. With the war coming to
an end Hitler tried to quicken the extermination of Jews. A lot of resistance
started in the concentration camps. The average kind of resistance in the
concentration camps was to escape because if they didn't try the life expectancy
in a concentration camp was six months. Most attempts failed and the escapees
were gunned down, but some escaped only to starve.</font>
<br><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the camps were liberated
by the Allies they were in shock as they saw the starving people and loads
of corpses. Thanks to the resistance some people weren't with those dead
bodies. In my personal opinion I think people who were part of the resistance
were just as much heroes as and survivors because they starved and were
sent to camps as well as killed like a soldier. They are the unsung heroes
of World War Two. To end my report I would like to say a quote I heard
, "The dead pay the debt for the living''. I think that quote is very true
because so many people die for what they think is right. To make the living
peoples life better.</font>
