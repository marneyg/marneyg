than 60 years ago a place called Auschwitz was being built and soon would
be known to over 1.6 million people made up of , Jews, gypsies, homosexuals,

Auschwitz was the largest extermination camp duing World War II.&nbsp;
The camp had came up with two different ways to exterminate their prisoners
, extermination by labor and extermination by zyklon B in the gas chambers(zyklon
B is the poisonious gas ).&nbsp; With zyklon B ,&nbsp; they would take
the prisoners and put them into the small gas chambers that would resemble
a shower room with 500-600 prisoners in the at the same time.&nbsp; A small
peek hole at the top of the roof is where the zyklon B pelets would be
dropped in and the prisoners be killed in (estimated) 15 minutes.</font></font></td>

When trainloads of people would come in the Nazi soliders would have the
women and children form a line and the men form a separate line.&nbsp;
Any children or pregnant women would be sent to the gas chamber line immeditly.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then the soliders would pick the ones that were "fit for work" and the
rest would be sent straight to the gas chamber line also.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="LongIsland"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The others
that were "fit for work" were taken to go and get tattooed, shaved bald
, and given practically rags to wear as their clothing.&nbsp; Then they
were sent to work .&nbsp; Some of the common work was digging ditches for
the rotting corpses to be thrown into.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="LongIsland"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The living
conditions was very poor at Auschwitz, even though all of the concentration
camps were, most of the prisoners at Auschwitz died from cruel labor, diesease,
or starvation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="LongIsland"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Today Auschwitz is a museaum archive to the Polish government.&nbsp; Mostly
everything is still there,&nbsp; including what the prisoners wore, wooden
shoes,&nbsp; what they ate out of, and many other interesting things.</font></font>
<p><font face="LongIsland"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The best tribute we can give to the hundreds of thousands of people whose
lives were taken in the concentration camps and truly live a "hell on earth"
is&nbsp; to never forget.</font></font>
