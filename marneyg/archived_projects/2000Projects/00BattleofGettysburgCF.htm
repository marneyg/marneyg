General George G. Meade, for the Union, was hired by Abraham Lincoln to
stop General Robert E. Lee, of the Confederates, from advancing into the
north.&nbsp; Meade and Lee were both trekking north knowing that the enemy
was probably only two to three days away.&nbsp; Meade was looking for a
good defensive line near the Maryland border where he hoped to face Lee.&nbsp;
Meade and Lee were both headed toward the little town of Gettysburg to
spy on each others movements.</font></font></b></td>

Unknown to Lee Yankee cavalry held the town while Heth and Davis, of the
Confederates, were studying a way to get around the town.&nbsp; Heth ordered
Davis to the south and Archer to the north while the Union’s two brigades
of cavalry prowled around the town.&nbsp; While Archer on his mission bumped
into them with is infantry brigade.&nbsp; The Union managed to hold them
off for about an hour.&nbsp; After Archer got through he marched right
into fresh Union infantry where he was captured.&nbsp; Davis hitting strong
ended up having most of his brigade taken prisoner.&nbsp;</font></font></b></td>

During this Meade was about nine miles south of town, but had received
notice from Hancock Gettysburg would be the best place to make a stand
against Lee.&nbsp; He arrived at 11:30 p.m. on July 1 at Cemetery Ridge
(the first of three days battle).&nbsp; Cemetery Ridge was best the best
place for a defensive line which is where Meade made the Union’s headquarters..&nbsp;
After the first day of battle 18,000 men fought for the Union over half
were killed.</font></font></b></td>

Lee made headquarters at Seminary Ridge, he wanted Culp’s Hill.&nbsp; He
moved Ewell to the right, but unknown to Lee General Slocum, of the Union,
already had troops there.&nbsp;</font></font></b></td>

On the second day Lee had to fight with his guys in a crescent.&nbsp; Lee
told Longstreet to attack Union left with 16,000 men.&nbsp; During this
Sickle, of the Union, was about to be attacked and he wouldn’t be able
withstand it unless on higher ground.&nbsp; So he decided to move to a
supposed stronger point without Meade’s permission.&nbsp; Longstreet had
already attacked Sickle before Meade could get him back and Sickle suffered
devastatingly.&nbsp; After the second day the Confederates had many men
and gained little ground.&nbsp;</font></font></b></td>

When July 3 came about the battle picked up where it left off.&nbsp; Ewell
still clung to the slopes of Culp’s Hill while Longstreet had to take 12,000
men and march over 1,000 yards in the open.&nbsp; This forced Meade to
relocate headquarters to Power’s Hill.&nbsp; Pettigrew now with Pickett,
of the Confederates, moved eastward, and began to bunch near the center.&nbsp;
The Union formed an almost 90 degree angle, and the Confederates were forced
to seek cover.&nbsp; Hand-to-Hand combat broke out which was later called
“Pickett’s Charge.”&nbsp; The Confederates were drove out and now badly
outnumbered and cutoff from reinforcements.&nbsp; They retreated back to
Seminary Ridge.&nbsp; Pickett had lost nearly 3,000 men.&nbsp; Meade wanted
to stay put and not risk an attack on Seminary Ridge.</font></font></b></td>

The casualties were great for both sides.&nbsp; The Union had 3,155 killed,
14,530 wounded, and 5,365 missing which totaled 23,040 men.&nbsp; The south
had 2,600-4,500 killed, 12,800 wounded, and 5,250 missing which totaled
20,650-25,000 men.&nbsp; It was pretty devastating for both even though
the Union won.</font></font></b></td>
