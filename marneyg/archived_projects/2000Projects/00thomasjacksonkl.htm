Jackson was born in Clarksburg, Virginia.&nbsp; He was a graduate from
the West Point Military Academy and served in the Mexican War from 1846
to 1848.&nbsp; After the Mexican War his higher-ranking officers promoted
his ranking because of his great effort in the war.&nbsp; After that he
became a professor of Military Tactics at the Virginia Military Institute.</font></font></td>

He then went on with his brigade to fight at Manassas in the first battle
of Bull Run.&nbsp; In this battle Jackson earned his nickname “Stonewall”
and the brigade was later named the “Stonewall” brigade.&nbsp; Later that
fall he was promoted to Major General.</font></font></td>

Later in the war Jackson and his “Stonewall” brigade were sent to capture
Harpers Ferry, which he and his men successfully did.&nbsp; He was then
promoted to having full command of the now-official second Corps. Before
this it had been a command or a wing.</font></font></td>

On his greatest day he led his brigade around the right side of the Union
flank at Chancellorsville breaking it at its weak point.&nbsp; Later that
night after observing advances that had taken place that day he was coming
back to his own lines and was mistakenly shot in the left arm by one of
his own men. After the amputation of his arm General Robert E. Lee wrote,
“He has lost his left arm but I have lost my right arm.” He said this because
of&nbsp; Jackson’s great skill as a leader.&nbsp; Jackson was considered
Lee’s right arm because the two of them worked well together and fit each
other well.</font></font>

“Stonewall” Jackson died on May 10,1863 at 3:15 in the afternoon. Many
people mourned over the loss of this great leader including the cadets
at the Virginia Military Institute that he was teaching.</font></font>
<p><font face="Heather"><font color="#33FF33">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One thing he was remembered for besides his leadership and capability to
rally troops was his deep religious beliefs. It was said that he would
lead prayers</font> <font color="#33FF33">in camp and he always regretted
fighting on Sunday.</font></font></td>
