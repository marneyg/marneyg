Prison Camp was in Elmira, New York.&nbsp; It was eight acres of land by
the Chemung River.&nbsp; It was on ground that was level and lower then
all of the land around it, so it didn't drain very well.&nbsp; In the rainy
season it became very muddy and squishy.&nbsp; It was made up of post barracks
built to accommodate up to four thousand people.&nbsp; The barracks were
a single story wooden building with two rows of crudely built double bunks.&nbsp;
Each barrack could hold forty-five to fifty bunks.&nbsp; Around the perimeter
of the prison camp was a twelve ft. wooden board fence with sentry boxes
and elevated platforms to position guards in.</font></font></td>

July 6, 1864 the first POWs arrived at Elmira. They were 400 men from Point
Lookout brought to Elmira to relieve overcrowding there.&nbsp; On July
12, 502 more men were brought in.&nbsp; On July 15 a fourth trainload of
prisoners on route to Elmira collided with an eastbound coal train.&nbsp;
Forty-eight POWs and seventeen guards were killed.&nbsp; Ninety-three POWs
and sixteen guards were injured.&nbsp; And then in all of the confusion
five POWs escaped.&nbsp; By the end of the month of July there were over
4,424 men confined there.&nbsp; There had been two escapes and eleven deaths.&nbsp;
The government allowed the prison to use half an acre of land as a cemetery.&nbsp;
They named it Woodlawn Cemetery.</font></font></td>

who helped take care of the cemetery and bury the dead got forty dollars
a month.&nbsp; John W. Jones a former slave from Leesburg, Virginia lived
near the prison.&nbsp; He took charge of the Confederate burials and went
on to keep accurate death records of deaths in Elmira prison throughout
the history of it.</font></font></td>

the end of August 9,600 POWs were being held there.&nbsp; Less then ten
percent had blankets and most didn't even have a handful of straw to keep
warm with.&nbsp; On August 7 there were no more tents.&nbsp; The ones they
got shipped in were ragged and shredded.&nbsp; By the end of August there
were 115 deaths.&nbsp; By the end of September there were 385 deaths.&nbsp;
A majority of the deaths were from diarrhea and dysentery.&nbsp; Scurvy
broke out among the prison also.&nbsp; On September 11 there were over
1,870 cases of scurvy around the camp.&nbsp; Elmira led all the northern
prisons in the death rate, which was an average of about ten deaths a day.&nbsp;</font></font></td>

was unlike any other prisons because instead of starting out as a fairly
acceptable place it was always a concentration camp.&nbsp; It was known
as the worst prison in the north.&nbsp; From the start to the finish 2,933
people died and only 17 escaped.&nbsp; The most people held there was 9,441
men.&nbsp;</font></font></td>
