Anne Frank was a young lady that ended up having to go into hiding when
she was only thirteen years old to get away from the germans just because
she was a Jew.&nbsp; Anne frank was born in 1929 in Frankfurt.&nbsp; Anne
had one sister named Margot and her parents names were Edith and Otto Frank.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Comic Sans MS">Her
parents did not really see a future for them and their family where they
were living.&nbsp; So in 1933 they packed up and moved to the Netherlands.&nbsp;
At this time Anne was only four years old.&nbsp; In the year 1940 Germany
took over the Netherlands.&nbsp; So now the protection that Holland provides
is over.&nbsp; In the year 1942 is when all the ''work camps'' began.&nbsp;
So that the Franks wouldn't be found and taken to one of the work camps
they ended up going into hiding.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They went
into hiding in the annex of the building that houses Otto's buisness.&nbsp;
During the time that Anne and her family were in hiding at the secret annex
Anne wrote in her diary alot.&nbsp; Anne got her diary on her thirteenth
birthday on June 12, 1942 in Amsterdam.&nbsp; When Anne went into hiding
she had no way to talk or be contacted with the outer world which got very
lonely.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So she made
up an imaginary friend named Kitty.&nbsp; Also in the year 1942 all Jews
ages six and up had to wear a yellow star of David so that people could
tell the difference between the Jews and the Germans.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On August forth
1944 at about 10:00 Anne and her family and some other people that were
staying with them in the ''Secret Annex'' were found.&nbsp; At this time
when Anne and the other people were found Anne had been in hiding now for
25 months.&nbsp; While Anne was in hiding she once wrote in her diary:
''I've reached the point where I hardly care whether I live or die.&nbsp;
The world will keep turning without me and I can't do anything to change
events anyway.&nbsp; I'll just let matters take their course and concentrate
on studying and hoping that everything will be alright in the end''.&nbsp;
And she wrote this okn February 3, 1944.&nbsp; Now that Anne and the seven
other people that were in the secret annex with her were arrested and sent
to Auschwitz.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were in Auschwitz
for a month and after a month there Anne and her sister Margot were sent
to the Bergen-Belson camp.&nbsp; When Anne was once at this camp she once
said:''It was utterly impossible for me to build my life on a foundation
of chaos, suffering and death.&nbsp; I see the world transforming into
a wilderness, I hear the approaching thunder that one day will destroy
us too, and I feel the suffering of millions.&nbsp; But, yet when I look
up at the sky, I somehow feel that everything will change for the better,that
this cruelty too shall end,that peace and tranquility will return once
more.''&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp; While at Bergen-Belson Anne and her
sister Margot developed a sickness named typhus.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They both died
within a short period of time.&nbsp; When Anne died she was fifteen years
old and when Margot died she was nineteen years old.&nbsp; During the Holocaust
ore than one million children died under the age of sixteen.&nbsp; Out
of the eight people hiding in the ''secret annex'' Anne's father was the
only one to survive. When he was released from from the camp when all this
was over He got Annes diary and published it just as she had dreamed.&nbsp;
Annes diary is also one of the most well-known books.&nbsp; So thats the
story of Anne Frank.</font>
