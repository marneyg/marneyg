On March 21,1933 Heinrich Himmler made it known that the concentration
camp in Dachau was established. Dachau was the first German concentration
camp. In June 1933 Theodor Eicke became commandant of the concentration
camp. Later, Eicke was appointed inspector of all the concentration camps.
He made Dachau the ''Murder School'' for the members of the SS.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="LongIsland"><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first prisoners were political opponents, communists, social democrats,
members of trade unions, and conversitive and liberal parties.The first
Jewish prisoners were imprisoned</font></font></font>
<br><font face="LongIsland"><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+1>in Dachau
because of their political beliefs. After the November Programs in 1983,
the so-called ''Crystal Night'' more than 10,000 Jews were brought to Dachau.
From 1983 on, the prisoners in the concentration camp in Dachau reflected
the National Socialist Aggression. In</font></font></font>
<br><font face="LongIsland"><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+1>March 1939
Czech prisoners were brought to Dachau, and after being of the war prisoners
from Poland, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. All together
there were more</font></font></font>
<br><font face="LongIsland"><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+1>than 200,000
prisoners from more than 30 countries imprisoned in Dachau.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="LongIsland"><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From 1942 a network of subsidairy camps and work detachments were established
in which over 30,000 prisoners worked. The nazis decided to produce huge
underground factories. During the war Dachau became a place of mass murder.
In October 1941 thousands</font></font></font>
<br><font face="LongIsland"><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+1>of Soviet
prisoners were brought to Dachau and shot. Prisoners were misused by SS
doctors for medical experiments. An unknown number of prisoners died. In
January 1942 more than 3000 prisoners were murdered with carbon monoxide
at Hartheim castle near Linz. Prisoners died of starvation,&nbsp; sickness,
exhaustion, degradation, beating, and torture. They were shot, hanged,
and killed with injections. In 1944 a gas chamber was built in Dachau concentration
camp, but was not used. On April 27,1945 approximately 7,000 prisoners
from the main camp were sent on a march towards the Alps. A few days before
the liberation there were more than 6,7000 Dachau concentration camp prisoners.
Half of them were in the main</font></font></font>

Jewish meant being killed, and Christian meant being protected. Germans
often hid Jews,</font></font></font>
<br><font face="LongIsland"><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+1>and changed
their names to German names. They did this to protect them. The Jews were
disappointed in their god for not protecting them. Germans who tried to
hide Jews could be arrested or even killed.</font></font></font>
