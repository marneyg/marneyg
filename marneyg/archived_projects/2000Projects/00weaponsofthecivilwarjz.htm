Weapons were the main problem in the civil war, tactics were old and based
on the facts that weapons were inaccurate and unreliable, but for the most
part the weapons used in the Civil War accurate and DEADLY. The Standard
Military fire arm was the rifle musket so called because on the inside
of the barrel was “rifled” with spiral grooves, which gave better accuracy
than smoothbore weapons. These weapons were four feet long an about nine
pounds, and accurate up to about two hundred and fifty yards.&nbsp;</font></font></font></td>

Rifles were very hard to use because loading took so much time, an experienced
solider could only get about three shoots a minute. These are the steps
for loading a Civil War rifle: 1] Steady the weapon on the ground while
he took a new cartridge from his belt, 2] Rip open the paper cartridge
with his teeth, 3] Empty the powder into the gun barrel and insert the
bullet into the muzzle, 4] Draw the “rammer “ out of its carrying groove
under the barrel, 5] Ram the cartridge into the barrel with the rod, 6]
Return the rammer to its groove, 7] Lift the weapon half cock the weapon
and remove the old “precession cap” and place a new one in its place on
the nipple under the hammer, 8] fully cock the hammer……aim……and finally….FIRE.</font></font></font></td>

Almost all rifles had bannets, but were not used as a weapon as much as
candle holders, eating utensils, they were also used to dig holes to hide
in if there was a charge. There are two types of artillery Heavy and Light.
Heavy consisted of mostly large smoothbore cannons, and were responsible
for seacoast, mountain, and garrison artillery. Light was divided into
to sections Calvary and mounted.&nbsp;</font></font></font></td>

On June 18 1861 the secret weapon “Enterprise”, a balloon, was unveiled
to the public. It was to be used to spy on the Southern attackers. In August
the Confederates shot the world's first anti-aircraft battery against the
Union balloon near Arlington. It failed to make contact but the balloonists
were so scared they returned to the ground as quickly as they could. There
were many weapons in the Civil War and I didn’t talk about them all, but
I tried to talk about the important ones.&nbsp;</font></font></font></td>
