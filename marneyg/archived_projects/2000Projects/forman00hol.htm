Ghettos have been used since A.D.70. They have been mostly for Jews until
the end of World War II. The Minsk and Riga ghettos were just two of the
many different ghettos used in World War II. When Adolf Hitler became furher
of Germany, Jews paid the price. Some were sent to ghettos, concentration
camps or they were killed for disobeying orders. Anne Frank was also a
Jew. She died in a concentration camp. Mr. Frank was the only member of
the family to survive. He later chose to publish his daughters diary. Their
hiding place was called the "Secret Annex" by Anne.</font><font color="#000000">.</font>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minsk Ghetto was
started after German tanks entered the city on June 28,1941. Jewish men
from the age of 15-45 were ordered to appear at a registration point. Failure
to obey would result in death. By July15, 1941, the registration of the
Jews was complete. They were ordered to wear a yellow star on their chest
and backs. They couldn't walk down the main streets.If any Jew was found
in the non-Jewish part of the city, they would be arrested and severally
punished. Workers were given 300 grams of bread a day and a dark water
called soup. Some Jews starved to death.</font>
