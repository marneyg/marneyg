Karl Adolf Eichmann, the Grand Inquisitor, was born on March 19, 1906 in
Solingen, Germany.&nbsp; He later moved to Linz, Austria which was where,
the fuhrer, Hitler grew up.&nbsp; When he was young his friends and classmates
called him, the little Jewish boy, because he looked so much like a Jewish
boy.&nbsp; He was always teased about his looks and dark complexion.&nbsp;
When he got older he worked at many places like his fathers mining company,
he worked in sales for a electric company, and he worked for an American
Oil Company.</font></font></font></b></li>

In 1932, he joined a secret NAZI Party that one of his closest friends
suggested.&nbsp; When the NAZI Party fell apart he decided to&nbsp; join
a terrorist school of the Austrian League at Lechfield, Barvari, in 1933.&nbsp;
In 1934 he left the terrorist school and became a member of the SS.&nbsp;
Then that same year he moved up rapidly to a SS Corporal at Dachau concentration
camp in, 1934.&nbsp; The same year in September he got a job in Heydrich's
SD service, the powerful security service, where he started out filing
information about freemasons.&nbsp; Next, he moved up to collecting information
on all prominent Jews and all of this led to his interest in the Jewish
people.&nbsp; He quit his job and started studying about the Jewish culture,
he attended Jewish meetings, he visited Jewish sections of cities while
taking many notes, and he soon became a self expert of the Jewish people
and was called a Jewish specialist.&nbsp; He finally quit studying about
Jewry and was soon appointed by Heydrich and Himmler to a newly created
SD scientific museum of Jewish affairs.&nbsp; After working at the museum
a for a year or two he was sent to Vienna where he established a central
office for Jewish emigration where he let Jews leave the country for their
worldly possessions.&nbsp; After a year he returned to Berlin, Germany
and was appointed head of Gestapo Section IV B4 of the new Reich Main security
office where he was responsible for implementation of NAZI policy towards
the Jews in Germany and other occupied territories of Europe.&nbsp; In
1942, Eichmann went to the Wannsee Conference where they planned the "final
solution" or the final extermination of the Jewish race in Europe.&nbsp;
After the conference he was considered assistant architect of the "final
solution".&nbsp; Next, Eichmanns sole purpose was to work on the "final
solution".&nbsp; He helped come up with the idea of using Zyklon B.&nbsp;
He helped Rudolf Hess pick out sitings for the gas chambers.&nbsp; After
that he had been assigned to deport the Jews to extermination camps like
Auschwitz and Dachau.&nbsp; In an eighteen month period he reduced Austria's
Jewish population by about one half to one hundred fifty thousand Jewish
people.&nbsp; He was responsible for rounding up and deporting five to
six million Jews to their deaths.&nbsp; He then was considered a madman&nbsp;
because he was ordered by many Generals to stop deporting Jewish people
to their deaths and would not stop deporting them because he was upsessed
with killing the Jews.&nbsp;</font></font></font></b></li>

After the war Adolf Eichmann was caught by the U.S. soldiers and spent
only a year in prison camp because he escaped.&nbsp; After that he stayed
in the Middle East for several years after he had escaped.&nbsp; He soon
fled to Argentina, South America where he took up the name of Ricardo Klement
and he had a wife and three kids.&nbsp; He caused one of the biggest manhunts
ever in world history because it took over a decade until he was finally
found by Israeli secret service agents next to Buenos Aires, Argentina.&nbsp;
Then he was smuggled out of the country very carefully and taken to Jerusalem,
Israel where he was put on trial from April 11 to December 15, 1961.&nbsp;
He pleaded not guilty on fifteen accounts.&nbsp; He was later found guilty
on crimes against Jewish race and humanity.&nbsp; He was sentenced to death
by&nbsp; way of hanging.&nbsp; He died on May 31, 1962 in Israel.&nbsp;
Adolf Eichmann is now considered to be one of the most upsessed Jewish
killers of all.&nbsp; He is also considered to be one of the wars most
notorious war criminals.</font></font></font></b></li>
