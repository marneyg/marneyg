<td>Clara Barton was born on December 25, 1821.&nbsp; She probably never
knew that she would grow up to be one of the greatest people ever to have
something to do with the Civil War.&nbsp; She first began work by collecting
and distributing brandy and tobacco and lemons, soaps and she also distributed
and collected sewing kits and homemade jellies.</td>

<tr>
<td>The first time that she had anything to do with the battlefields was
on August 2, 1861 in Fredericksburg she delivered supplies.&nbsp; She was
inspired to do this by her former landlady named Elmira Fales.&nbsp; She
did not start working during the Civil War until after the Battle of Bull
Run in 1861.&nbsp; She started out taking supplies to the soldiers and
caring for the wounded brought to her.&nbsp; She did her work so well that
she soon became known as “Angel of the Battlefield”.&nbsp;</td>

<tr>
<td>During her time of helping the wounded soldiers of the Civil War she
helped them at Cedar Mountain, The Second Bull Run, Chantilly, South Mountain,
and Antietam.&nbsp; While serving very close to the front lines at Antietam
a bullet passed her sleeve and killed a soldier that she was caring for.&nbsp;
Also while working on the battlefields she operated on a soldier with a
bullet in his cheek. Clara said when she first started working as a nurse
in the Civil War” She quickly found out her place is anywhere between the
bullet and the battlefield.”&nbsp;</td>

<tr>
<td>Other things she did and said while working on the battlefield and
in the hospitals was that once she had to use a penknife to get a bullet
out of a soldier.&nbsp; In an old hotel 500 men lying on the cold, wet
and bloody floor begging her to give them a cracker or something to drink
so they could survive.&nbsp; She also once said, “I had to wring the blood
from the bottom of my clothing before I could step, for the weight about
my feet.” Clara Barton also found the American Red Cross.&nbsp; So these
are just many things that Clara Barton did during the Civil War.
