Auschwitz was a concentration camp for Jews, located west of Krakow, following
the defeat of Poland in September of 1939.&nbsp; Auschwitz held up to 10,000
Jews.&nbsp; The Jews were sent to Auschwitz in freight cars.&nbsp; They
were unloaded and examined.&nbsp; After this, any women and men who were
in good shape got tattooed with a number on their upper left arm and went
to a line to get ready for work.&nbsp; Women and men who were weak were
immediately exterminated.</font></font></font>

This happened to <i>all</i> the children.&nbsp; There was a brick wall
about two meters high that separated the men and women.&nbsp; After they
had got tattooed, the prisoners had to undress completely and get all their
head and body hair shaved off.&nbsp; Most of the women suffered just from
the humiliation of being naked and losing all their hair.&nbsp; Next, the
prisoners either got to take a short, ice cold shower or a short, boiling
hot shower.</font></font></font></td>

The Jews had it really rough.&nbsp; In the morning, they were awoken by
loud whistles.&nbsp; They had to make their beds perfectly.&nbsp; Next
there was breakfast.&nbsp;&nbsp; It consisted of a &frac12; of a liter
of unsweetened coffee or tea. Then there was roll call.&nbsp; After roll
call, they had to march to their working stations with the beat of music
played by the NAZI orchestra.&nbsp; They worked for 11 hours with &frac12;
an hour lunch break.&nbsp; For lunch, they got &frac34; of a liter of tasteless
soup made from potato peelings.&nbsp; At dinner time, they were given 300
grams of bread with either 25 grams of sausage or 35 grams of margarine.&nbsp;
It was also joined with one spoon of jam or cheese.&nbsp; Their food was
often cold or spoiled.</font></font></font>

<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>For their clothes,
They first started wearing blue and white striped drill garments.&nbsp;
Then later on, men got a shirt, long undergarments, a jacket, trousers,
and possibly a coat during the winter.&nbsp; Women seldom got underwear.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the beginning, pregnant women were sent straight to execution.&nbsp;
Some secretly had their babies in the camp overnight.&nbsp; If the babies
were discovered, which they were, the mother would soon die of blood poisoning.&nbsp;
The babies were taken somewhere to be shot by the S.S.</font></font></font>

On a regular account, they had to put fifteen people on a regular bed.&nbsp;
When the camp was overcrowded, they put forty-five people per bed.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Their rules were very strict.&nbsp; They got punished for a lot of stuff.&nbsp;
Like, they would get punished for leaving lumps in their beds or the straw
and blankets not being straight.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>Another thing
they were punished for was if their shoes were dirty.&nbsp; Their punishments
were either getting gassed, poisoned, shot, or hung.&nbsp; The majority&nbsp;
of people getting killed was by being gassed.&nbsp; They would put a large
group of people in a big chamber or room with a hole at the top.&nbsp;
The hole at the top had a lid.&nbsp; They would open the the lid and&nbsp;
drop a poisonous gas called, Zyklon B, (also known as Cyclone B), into
the chamber.&nbsp; They would close the lid and wait for 10-15 minutes.&nbsp;
When they would open the lid, the Jews would be dead.&nbsp; They would
kill about 9,000 people per day.&nbsp; After that they would cremate all
the bodies.</font></font></font>

To poison them, they would give them poison injections.&nbsp; They would
cremate the bodies after that, also.&nbsp; If the Jews tried to escape,
they would be shot down.&nbsp; Also, if they tried to run away or made
another crime, they would be hung.</font></font></font></td>

Auschwitz was closed down and deserted on January 27, 1945 when the Red
Army entered Auschwitz and freed about 7,000 remaining immates.&nbsp; Most
of them were ill or dying.&nbsp; I think the Jews had the hardest life
out of anybody.</font></font></font>
