<font color="#C0C0C0">Music and poetry was a very important part of the
Civil war. Robert E. Lee once wrote,&nbsp; “I don’t believe we can have
an army with out music” and to many of the solders that was very true.
During the Civil war music was used to express a solders feelings. Of course,
the two sides had a different point of view, but both sides had songs about
loved ones left behind and the tragedy on the battlefield. However, some
songs told stories of themselves and there experiences. One very popular
son with the union was Bars and Stripes. That was there version of Stars
and Stripes. It went something like this, “ Oh say can you see, though
perhaps your too tight. What so feebly we hailed at the twilights last
beaming. Whose broad bars and few stars, o’er our scurrilous flight. From
the rum shops we filched were so gaudily streaming. When the rockets red
glare and bombs bursting in air, gave proof though we ran that our rag
remained there. Oh say does that bar-strangled banner still wave? O’er
the land of the free, and the home of the slave?” This song was written
in 1861. It has three more verses, all of which end with the same line.
A few more of the north’s favorite patriotic songs were, America, Columbia
the Gem of the Ocean, and also Hail Columbia.&nbsp;</font></font></font></td>

was also a very important part of the war. This helped the solders to express
their more personal feelings in a way that wouldn’t get around. Henry Lynden
Flash was a confederate solider who wrote the following poem. “ Were gathered
here a feeble few of those who wore the gray. The larger and the better
half have mingled with the clay. Yet not so lost but now and then through
dimming mist we see. The deadly calm of stonewalls face, the lion front
of Lee.” My next poem was written by a union solider by the name of J.W.
Holman. This tells his feelings about the death of a friend. “ A soldier
had fallen! Tis well that we weep! Oh soft be his pillow and peaceful his
sleep. Far, far from his home, and his friends he loved most. He fell in
the conflict, and died by the post.” The Civil war is a very important
part of history. For those who do not have pictures use poetry and music
remembered from the civil war. They wrote so little about there thoughts
but explained so much about the war probly not knowing it would be one
of the most biggest parts of history.&nbsp;</font></font></font></td>
