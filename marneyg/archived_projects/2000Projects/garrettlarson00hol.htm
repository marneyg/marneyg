His Parents : Karl and Walhurga Mengele were owners of a machine tools
business.&nbsp; Mengele was part of the upper middle class.&nbsp; As a
child Mengele was a good student.&nbsp; He was sent to Munich in 1920's
where he was attracted to the racial theories of Alfred Roseunberg, the
"Philosopher" of National Socialism. As he became an adherent of the National
Socialist ideology.&nbsp; He moved to Frankfurt were he received his medical
degree studding under Otmar Von Verschuer, the director of the Institute
for Racial Hygiane at the University of Frankfurt.&nbsp; The main emphasis
of his research was the importance of heredity within the context of Nazi
" race science".&nbsp; By the time his education was finished Mengele was
a member of both the National Socialist Party and the SS.&nbsp; Mengele
was a fanatic anti-Semite and hated the Roma and the Sinta (Gypsies) even
more than he hated Jews.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="LongIsland"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the beginning of World War II, Mengele was activated for service with
the Waffen - SS. Mengele serviced as a medical officer with several units
in the invasion of the Soviet Union, receiving four medals for his actions.&nbsp;
After being wounded, Mengele was declared to an unit for active service
as a physician at Auschwitz on May 1943.&nbsp; Mengele was not chief Physician

Mengele fled from Auschwitz on January 17,1945, as the Soviet army advanced
across the crumbling German Reich towards Berlin.&nbsp; During the first
few years of the post - war era, Mengele remained in hiding on a farm near
Gunzburg.&nbsp; He assumed a fake identity, and worked as a farm hand.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<table COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>

info. through secret contacts with old Gunzburg friends. Incredibly Mengele
at first aspired to continue his career as a research scientist, but it
became increasingly apparent that the Allies were searching for war criminals.&nbsp;
Finally he decided that he was no longer safe in Europe, even though Neo
- Nazis offered and provided protection.&nbsp; Mengele escaped through
Italy to an ocean liner bound for Argentina. He spent the next 30 years
on the run from international authorities.&nbsp; Josef Mengele died in
a drowning accident on Feb. 11, 1979.</font></font></font></td>
