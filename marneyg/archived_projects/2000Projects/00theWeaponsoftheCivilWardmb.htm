<td>There were so many weapons used during the United States Civil War
that many were not recorded.&nbsp; Some accounts of weapons being used
went against other accounts. The weapons and weapon tactics are part of
the reason the Civil War is called the first ‘Modern war'. Many Weapons
were designed during the war. The Union was very well supplied with ammunition
because the North had many large factories, which also kept the union soldiers
from starving.&nbsp; Both sides rushed to Europe for guns, and when either
side bought weapons they bought them all so the other side couldn’t buy
them.&nbsp; The European gun makers knew that they could sell little puny
guns that hardly worked for high prices.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Many people used their own guns.&nbsp;&nbsp; They bought with their
own money or made it themselves. During the Civil War getting guns became
such a problem that after fighting a battle they would steal guns from
the enemy then later used it in battle.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>MUZZLE LOADING RIFLES were used at the start of the war then towards
the end lever action rifles were used towards the end of the War. Most
soldiers carried a side arms which were primarily .36 calibers. Although
before the confederates obtained repeating handguns they used .46 caliber
muzzle loading pistol was used by most Confederate soldiers.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>MORTARS&nbsp;&nbsp; were used greatly during the Civil War. Mortars
came in every size they were used to hit the enemy from a far distance
and hit large objects. The mortar could be put on wheels if it was smaller
but larger ones were carried on trains.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>SWORDS There were many different kinds of swords carried by soldiers
during the Civil War.&nbsp; Swords weren’t used much in combat during the
Civil War unless soldiers were desperately fighting.&nbsp; Swords were
mainly used to direct armies and show an officers rank. The more curve
in a officers sword the higher the rank.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GATLIN GUN The gatlin gun was revolutionary new weapon because it could
it went had rotating barrels so each barrel had time to cool. It corrected
the problem of the ‘Coffee Mill’ gun it was designed by the same inventor
of the Gatlin gun Dr. Richard Gatlin. It could shoot eight-hundred shots
per minute. It was fired by cranking it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>EUREKA This gun was designed by the Bilhurst Requa company. It fired
twenty five shots all at once.&nbsp; A crank was turned once to shoot all
the bullets. The bullets were connected to one strip. The Eureka was used
for hitting tightly gathered troops or the enemy coming over a bridge.
It was a good weapon because it was easily loaded and fired.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>MORTARS Mortars were used during the Civil War veried in every size.
They were carried on wheels or by train. Mortats were used from close and
far distance. They played a big part in hitting ships from land or just
the opposite. They were used in groups mostly or the bigger ones alone.&nbsp;</td>
