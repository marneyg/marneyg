weapon used in the Civil War is a Sharps Carbine.&nbsp; It was developed
primarily for Calvary, because of the shorter barrel.&nbsp; They were much
easier to handle on horse back than their longer brother the Breech-Loader.&nbsp;
Sharps were preferred because they could be loaded on a moving horse, something
virtually impossible with a Muzzle-Loader.&nbsp; Also, Breech-Loaders carbine
which fired moisture proof metallic cartridges, where more reliable than
rifles that fired paper cartridges.&nbsp; As I said be fore it is easier
to load a Sharps than a Muzzle-Loader.&nbsp; A Muzzle-Loader took 9 long
hard steps just to fire one shot.&nbsp; Even the most skilled solder could
only get three rounds off in a minute on the old Civil War Muzzle-Loader.
And No wonder.&nbsp; After each shot you have to (1) steady the gun on
the ground take out a new cartridge out of a belt pouch.&nbsp; (2) Tear
open a piece of paper with your teeth.&nbsp; (3) Empty the powder in the
barrel and insert a bullet&nbsp; in to the muzzle.&nbsp; (4) Draw the long
“rummer” out of its carrying groove under the barrel.&nbsp; (5) ram the
bullet all the way down.&nbsp; (6) Return the rod back to its groove.&nbsp;
(7) Lift the weapon half-cocked the hammer.&nbsp; (8) Fully cock the hammer,
aim, and finally,(9) fire.</font></font></font></td>
