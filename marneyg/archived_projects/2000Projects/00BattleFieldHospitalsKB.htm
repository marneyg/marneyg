the U.S. really had any idea what a laryngoscope, stethoscope, or ophthalmoscope

carry over a deadly disease to the next patient.&nbsp; It’s not surprising&nbsp;
that the number of men who died form disease and war wounds was far higher
than from bullets.&nbsp; Hospitalization was often regarded as equivalent
to a death sentence.</font></font></td>

gains were made in medicine profession during the war.&nbsp; One of these
was that hospital design improved dramatically.&nbsp; The major design
developed during the Civil War is still used today.&nbsp; The new hospital
design was a pavilion design where patients were separated into wards by
affliction, which somewhat stopped the transmission of disease in hospitals.&nbsp;
Medical procedures were also developed and refined, as any surgeon would
if he operated on so many patients a day.</font></font></td>

Department to improve sanitation, build large well-ventilated hospitals,

the efforts of the Sanitary Commission, some 560,000 soldiers died from,

<td><font face="Jester"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
the medical achievements of the Civil War were in the areas of field hospital
organization and personnel.&nbsp; At the beginning of the war, staffs were
haphazardly organized on an “as needed” basis.&nbsp; But these staffs were
usually too small, and healthy soldiers had to be left behind to care for
the sick and wounded.&nbsp; Anyone, regardless of medical skill, could
volunteer as a nurse.&nbsp; Hospital facilities were established in existing
unsanitary buildings or erected wherever convenient.&nbsp; By war’s end
this is all changed.&nbsp; Military hospital staffs became more permanent.
In 1861, Dorothea Dix was appointed Superintendent of the United States
Nursing Corps, and the idea of professional nursing was born.&nbsp; Finally,
hospital facilities were improved but the use of large, well-ventilated
hospital tents and more permanent, cleaner “pavilion hospitals.”&nbsp;</font></font></td>
