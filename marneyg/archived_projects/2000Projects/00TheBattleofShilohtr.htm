of this plan was to win the war in the west. To do so they would have to
seize the Mississippi River and split the Confederacy in half. The officer
they chose to execute the plan was Major General Ulysses S. Grant. At the
same time President Jefferson Davis and his generals developed their own
plan to destroy the Union Army and capture Washington D.C.<span style="mso-spacerun:

April 27,1822 U.S. Grant was born in Ohio he was raised a country boy and
for that reason became very good with horses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In
1839 he went to WestPoint Military Academy, where he graduated the lowest
in his class. In 1846-1848 he fought in the Mexican-American War where
he showed promise as an Officer.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>After
the war he was stationed in California and his new wife stayed in Missouri.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Because
of this separation he started to drink too much.<span

drinking forced him to resign his commission and he returned to Galena,
Ohio with his wife to run his father’s mercantile store.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>He
was a very bad businessman and by the start of the Civil War the store

the start of the Civil War the governor of Ohio gave Grant a Commission

first he served as a Recruiting officer and later he was given command
of a small army.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>With this
army and with the help of the Union Navy in early 1862 Grant captured Fort
Henry and Fort Donelson that were located on both the Cumberland and Tennessee
Rivers.<span style="mso-spacerun:

moved his Army south where he planned to meet up with General Buell who
was marching south crossing the Tennessee River. Buell was to meet Grant
at Savanna, Tennessee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>At a
place called Pittsburgh Landing Grant pushed his forces out and on April
6,1862 was attacked by General Johnston at 5:00 A.M. in the morning.<span

was a surprise attack and took the Union forces completely off guard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The
Union Army was routed and hundreds of its soldiers were slaughtered.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>At
2:30 P.M. that same afternoon Johnston was wounded in the back of the leg,
the bullet hit a major artery and because Johnston refused any medical
attention and kept on commanding his forces, he bled to death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>With
his death the Confederate States of America lost one of its best Generals.<span

fire started and burned a lot of the wounded soldiers to death and those
who were not burned died of thirst and a lot of the dying soldiers were
found by a pond that was on the battlefield. A great number of them died
while trying to get a drink and the water the next morning had turned pink
from the blood of the dead. A rainstorm put out the fires.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

and when asked by General Sherman what he would do he answered “We lost
today we’ll lick em’ tomorrow.”<span

is very important because it shows the type of man General Grant was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>No

on fighting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The next morning
Buell joined Grant’s army and the two of them won the battle of Shiloh.<span
