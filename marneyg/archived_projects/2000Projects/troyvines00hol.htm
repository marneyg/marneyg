In September 1919 Hitler was investigating the German workers party and
decided to attend one of their meetings and while attending this meeting
he was compelled to stand up and speak to them. The leader of the party,
Anton Drexler, was impressed with Hitlers speech that he invited him to
join the parties committee. This was where he discoved his true talent.
In february 1920 the party was renamed "National Socialist German Workers
Party. Hitlers guards were named the SA , and it was after they attached
a rivils political meeting in 1921 that Hitler was sentence to three months
in prison. The fourth week in prison he was hailed a hero. On november
9,1923, Hitler led more than 2,000 Storm Troopers on march to seize the
Bavarian goverment. The attemped failed and Hitler was arrested and was
sentence to prison for five years for treason. In prison Hitler wrote a
book called Mien Kampf {My Struggle}. In this book, Hitler started his
beliefs and plans for Germany's future. Hitler only served 9 months in
prison and when he was released he set up a private battle ready elite
guard known as the "Schutzstaffel" {ss}. In 1930, a worldwide depression
hit Germany, Germany also had to pay for the damage they had causedin Wold
War 1. Hitler protested against paying the dept, and said that the Jews
and communists were the cause for Germany's defeat in World War 1, and
he promised to rid germany of jews and communists and to rewrite the German
speaking part of Europe. In july, 1932 the nazi received about 40% of the
vote and became the strongest party in Germany. On January 30, 1933 the
President appointed Hitler chancellor of Germany. Hitler moved with great
speed to outmanoever his rivals, vertually outing the conservatives from
any real pparticipation in goverment&nbsp; by july 1933, abolishing the
free trade union, eliminating the communsts, Social Democrats and Jews
form any role in political life and sweeping opponents into concitration
camps. The Reichstage fire of February 27, 1933 had provided him with the
perfect pretext to begin consolidating the foundations of a totalitasian
one-party State. With support from the nationalists, Hitler gained a majority
at the last {democratic} elections held in Germany on March 5, 1933 and
with cynical skill he used the whole gamut of persuasion.&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+2></font></font>
