to End</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adolf
Hitler was born April 20, 1889.&nbsp; After his birth his father moved
the family to Lina, Austria.&nbsp; Hitler attended school in lina.&nbsp;
Hitler was a poor student, he was failing in almost ever class.&nbsp; His
teachers did not think much of him.&nbsp; Hitler quieted school at the
age of eighteen.</font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adolf
Hitler moved to Vienna, Austria because he wanted to be a artist, his father
wanted him to work for the German government.&nbsp; Hitler wanted to go
t the Vienna Artist College in Vienna.&nbsp; Hitler failed the entry exam.&nbsp;
Hitler was convents that he had to get in to Vienna Artist College or he
might as well go join the army.&nbsp; Hitler failed the entry exam again.&nbsp;
In Vienna Hitler gained the hate for non-Germans.&nbsp; So he considered
him self to be German.&nbsp; Hitler joined the army in 1914.&nbsp; Hitler
did not do very good in the army, he only made it up to privet.&nbsp; The
war ended and Hitler was ready for more.</font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hitler
joined the National Socialist German Workers Party, known as the Nazis,
in 1920.&nbsp; This so called the Nazis was considered a small political
group but was no threat.&nbsp; They were wrong.&nbsp; Hitler made the Nazis
even more stronger.&nbsp; Hitler organized a party called the Storm Troopers
(or the Black Shirts).&nbsp; On November 9, 1923 Hitler led 2,000 Storm
Troopers on a "war march" to size the Bavarian government.&nbsp; Hitler's
plan failed.&nbsp; 1,500 Storm Troopers injured or dead.&nbsp; Hitler him
self was wounded and sent to jail for five years, were he wrote his famous
Mien Kampf (My Struggle).&nbsp; With Hitler jating his hate and plans to
kill the jewish, gay, Negroes, and gypsies.&nbsp; Hitler was realest from
jail and restated the Nazis.&nbsp; It became an important minor political
party.</font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
January 30, 1933 President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler to be Chancellor
of Germany.&nbsp; After President Paul von Hindinburg died Hitler gave
him self the name "Fueher" wicth means leader.</font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
was no for the Third Reich, witch was what Hitler called his government.&nbsp;
Hitler was using propaganda to brainwash the nations people to believe
his theory about creating the perfect Aryan or nordic race, its charistics
was a tall blond haired blue eyed German like his favorite action hero
when he was a little boy.</font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adolf
Hitler's plan the Final Solution was to rid the nation eventually the world
of jewish people, gypsies, negroes, handicapped, and mental illed people.&nbsp;
This led to the Kristalnight witch means night of broken glass.&nbsp; This
means all over Germany and other allied countries boycotted jewish stores
and beat jewish people on stages and made the jewish families wacth as
they beat them.&nbsp; They also arrested people who hid jews in their homes
they also pushed out the jews into Poland.&nbsp; This began World War 2
witch consontraction camps sprouted up all over.&nbsp; A concentration
camp was a camp were they sent jews to be killed, gassed, beaten, or to
work to death.&nbsp; World War 2 stated because of hitler invaded Poland.
Hitler caused over 12 million people in his rain to die.&nbsp; At the very
end of his life, his mind was clear as a flash of light.&nbsp; The testament
he dictated with extraordinary composure on the eve of his death, at three
in the morning of April 29, 1945.&nbsp; Hitler shook hands with his associates
in silence, he than eat breakfast like any other morning, he than went
to his death with his wife Eva Braun Hitler.&nbsp; They committed suicide
in his bunker on April 30, 1945.&nbsp; Two months later in May 1945 Germany
surrendered.</font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Soviet's
secret on Hitler amazes me because after Soviet troops advanced through
the rains of Berlin and the war ended, Joseph Stalin announced Hitler was
dead, but two months later he told America's president Harry Truman that
the Fuehrer's (Hitler) body was never been found.&nbsp; For decades, there
were reported sightings of Hitler.</font></font>
