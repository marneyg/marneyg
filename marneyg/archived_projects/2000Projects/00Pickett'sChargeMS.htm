the Battle of Gettysburg, Pickett’s charge began.&nbsp; Lee had ordered
12,000 men to march over 1,000 yards across open ground.&nbsp; The Confederate
line would stretch over a mile.</font></td>

Ridge with Pickett and Trimble’s division and they started moving eastward.
Union batteries from Cemetery Hill immediately opened fire on the advancing
line opening temporally gaps in the unit.&nbsp; When the Confederates were
within 400 yards the Union began firing canisters and were also within
Union rifle range.&nbsp;</font></td>

three of the nine brigades in the attacking Confederate forces.&nbsp; Pickett
is a 38-year-old career solider from Virginia.&nbsp; Pickett’s division
spearheaded the assault, advancing with parade precision.&nbsp; Almost
immediately, gaps were blown in the Confederate lines from Union artillery
positions.&nbsp; Under orders not to fire and not to let loose their Rebel
Yell, the Confederate closed the gaps in their lines and kept advancing.&nbsp;
Union artillery changed from shells to canisters. Canisters are tin cans
packed with iron balls that made giant shotguns out of the canons, and
they mowed great swaths through the Confederate ranks.&nbsp; As the attackers
continued to close, Union infantry sent volleys of minie balls into the
Southern troops that were ordered to stay put.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size=+2>Surviving Rebels returned fire and charged the Union
line.&nbsp; Hand to hand fighting ensued as the Union line was penetrated,
but there were not enough Confederates left after the charge to hold the
line.&nbsp; The Confederates, only choice was to surrender or go back across
the open ground.</font></td>
