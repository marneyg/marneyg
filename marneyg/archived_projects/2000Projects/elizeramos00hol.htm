<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>The Vilna Ghetto was one of the
many ghettos to keep Jews in until they could</font></font>
<br><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>be exterminated.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>In 1939,Lithuania received Vilna
in exchange for a defense pact and the presence of the Soviet troops in
hopes that they would be protected from the advancing German army.What
the Jews feared was persecution under Nazi rule.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>On Oct.28, Lithuania&nbsp; took
back control of Vilna and there was an outbreak of anti Jewish riots.As
rioters ransacked the city,Lithuanian policemen beat Jewish victims rather
than trying to reconvince peace.The riots lasted for three days.Lithuania
was charged with having kidnapped Soviet soldiers and of having entered
into military pacts with Estonia and Latvia.Estonia and Latvia were considered
a breach of the Soviet-Lithuanian defense pact of Oct.10,1939.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>The Germans managed to trick the
Soviets into helping them with the extermination of the Jews and lead the
Jews to believe they were being taken care of until the moment they faced
a gun barrel.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During Sept.3rd
and 5th, the Germans began to prepare for the establishment of two ghettos.The
ghettos would be divided by Niemiecka Street.The Vilna Ghetto was established
Sept.6,1941.It contained 40,000 Jews.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several days
after they moved in ,they learned that ghetto No.1 was designated for craftsmen
and workers with permits.Everyone else would move to ghetto No.2.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sept.15, 3,000
people headed towards the second ghetto.Only 600 people reached its gate.The
rest were taken to Lukiszki and then Ponar were they met their demise (death).</font></font>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 600 Jews
that reached the second ghetto had no idea what had happened.They didn't
even think that the Germans had ordered the transfer.</font></font>
<br><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>They believed it was the ghetto
No.1 Judernat cleaning up their ghetto.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Germans continued
to deceive the Jews,by telling them they were being transferred for work.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jews suffered
a great deal of pain.They were starved, beaten, put to work,poisoned by
poisonous gases,and killed. The list could go on and on.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did the Jews
suffer? Because some people thought that the reason the Germans lost WW1
was because of the Jews.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people believe
that the Jews deserved it.These people don't know what it feels like to
be stripped of their clothes,faith,and of their pride.These people</font></font>
<br><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>have no clue what it feels like
to lose their whole family.They don't know what it's like to see their
house and belongings burn to the ground.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will not
change their mind unless they experience the pain the Jews went through
in the Holocaust.</font></font>

this I would appreciate it if you'd bow your head, close your eyes, and
say a prayer for the ones who suffered in the Holocaust.</font></font>
