why do we have them?&nbsp; What is the purpose of them?&nbsp; They are
a symbolism of independence.&nbsp; They explain our past, present, and
future to come.&nbsp; The flag that flies over each state capitol represents
that state, and its people. Displaying a flag can show how you feel: angry,
happy, proud, disappointed, or trying to make a point.&nbsp; Changing the
flag, mayrepresent the change of government, and the type of government
for that matter.&nbsp; Flags have been used as far back as 5,000 years
ago.&nbsp; Flags show your opinion... and this... opinions... is the reason
of the Civil war.&nbsp;</font></font></b></td>

start with the North.&nbsp; Now, we have thirteen stripes for the thirteen
original colonies, and fifty stars, one for each state.&nbsp; But, do you
really know how the American flag, a.k.a. "Old Glory" was, lets say, in
1877?&nbsp; There weren't even stars!&nbsp; In fact, there were thirteen
stripes, as now, but instead of stars; it was a small replica of England
flag, in the upper left corner.&nbsp; This was changed as soon as The Untied
States of America became an independent country.&nbsp; From 1777 to 1795
the American flag consisted of thirteen white and red stripes, and fifteen
white stars.&nbsp; The stars had no specific order, either; rows, squares,
and even circles.&nbsp; The stars changed number, as the stripes remained,
to keep in mind of the thirteen colonies, which started the United States
of America.&nbsp; The US flag has changed a number of 27 times, each time,
adding a new start, represent each newly added state.&nbsp;</font></font></b></td>

why, but we have come up with one possibility!&nbsp; Ok, ok, ok... I shall
tell you now.&nbsp; The colors: red, white and blue.&nbsp; Just ordinary
colors, right?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; As of the flags, the colors themselves have
their own significant meaning.&nbsp; Blue, the color behind the white stars
stands for vigilance, perseverance, and justice.&nbsp; The red, one of
the colors of the stripes, mean hardness and courage.&nbsp; Something both
the Confederate and the Union had and fought for.&nbsp; And white, another
color of the stripes, stands for purity and innocence.&nbsp; All of these
colors and their meaning represent both the South and the North.</font></font></b></td>

flags!&nbsp; But, to make things short, there are three official national
Confederate flags, and one national battle flag.&nbsp; The first national
Confederate flag was flown between March 1861 and May 1863.&nbsp; The flag
strongly represented the Union flag, and was one the reasons the flag was
changed.&nbsp; Three rows: up and down: red, white, then red again. In
the upper left corner was a blue square, in it was a circle if seven stars,
which represented the following states: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida,
Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas.&nbsp; When fought in war, many,
many times were the flags confused by their resemblance.&nbsp;</font></font></b></td>

Battle Flag in the upper left corner.&nbsp; Not to succeed gaining Kansas
and Nebraska, the Confederate picked up four additional states: Virginia,
Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina.&nbsp; Having no problem with the
resemblance between the Confederate and the Union, the mistake was now
between the Confederate flag and the white surrender flag, especially during
calm, quiet days.</font></font></b></td>
