<p><b><font face="Invitation"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anne
Frank was born on June 12,1929 in Frankfurt Germany.&nbsp; She was the
second daughter of Edith and Otto Frank .&nbsp; Her sisters name was Margot.&nbsp;
She was three when Anne was born.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Invitation"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
being sisters Anne and Margot acted nothing alike.&nbsp; Margot was the
smart, shy, more mature one.&nbsp; She also got top grades in all classes.&nbsp;
Anne on the other hand was talkative, playful, and restless but she was
smart and her teachers still loved her.&nbsp; She had many friends of all
religions at school but that all changed in 1941.&nbsp; Hitler made a law
stating that Jews were no longer allowed to attend school with non Jews.&nbsp;
After that, things just got worse for Jews everywhere.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Invitation"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
1942 Jews were forced to wear yellow stars just to separate Jews from non
Jews.&nbsp; Jews were not allowed to drive cars, ride bicycles, trains,
or any other way of transportation.&nbsp; They had to do all shopping between
3 and 5:00 P.M. and had to be indoors by 8:00.&nbsp; Every day more and
more Jews were being arrested, beaten, and even killed.&nbsp; At least
2,000 were sent to concentration camps and 5,300 were gassed every day.&nbsp;
Atolf Hitlers vision of a perfect world seemed as though it were Hell,
and Hitler was the Devil.&nbsp; A Devil that would take years to stop.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Invitation"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
July 5, 1942 Annes family was celebrating her 13th birthday.&nbsp; She
got puzzles, posters, and games but her most favorite gift was a diary.&nbsp;
Anne put her most deepest emotions, thoughts, and memories in her diary.&nbsp;
She named her diary Kitty. To Anne, Kitty was the only person she could
talk to and trust. On that same evening Anne and her family went on a walk.&nbsp;
Her father, Otto, was talking about going into hide. Anne didn't like the
idea but she didn't want to die either.&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Invitation"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
they got back from the walk a man came to the door asking for Margot.&nbsp;
"Why would they want Margot" Anne thought to herself. Then the man said
he wanted her for a concentration camp.&nbsp; " But she's only 16 " Anne
wrote in her diary.&nbsp; She wouldn't dare say that to the man.&nbsp;
Fearful for their lives, the Frank family went into hiding that night.&nbsp;
Anne stuffed her book bag, put on some clean clothes, and the Frank family
left.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Invitation"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; July
6, Otto took his family through a secret door behind a bookcase.&nbsp;
The door lead to stairs that went to rooms above Otto's office.&nbsp; Since
there was a bookcase in front of the door it just looked like a wall, that
is where they hid.&nbsp; The employers kept working, acting like nothing
happened.&nbsp; Risking there lives every day for the Frank family.&nbsp;
Anne called these great and generous people helpers.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Invitation"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Frank family hid for twenty-five months before being found, arrested, and
then deported to the Auchwitz concentration camp.&nbsp; Anne did not bring
her diary because she did not want the Nazi police man to take it from
her.&nbsp; About a few months later, Anne and Margot came up with Typhus.&nbsp;
Two months later, Margot died.&nbsp; With the terrible loss of her sister
Anne started to give up. At this point Anne didn't care whether to live
or to die.&nbsp; In March 1945 Anne did die at age 15.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Invitation"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
the holocaust, Anne's diary was found by one of the helpers, Meip .G.,
it was published in 1947.&nbsp; Today her diary has been translated into
55 different languages and is one of the most widely read books in the
world.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Invitation"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
