Jews who were put into Auschwitz 1 were either gassed, killed by medical
experiments, or were worked over.&nbsp; Those who were curably ill were
put on a special diet.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Jews at Auschwitz 1 were put on a tight schedule.&nbsp; They were awakened
by signing whistles.&nbsp; Then they made their beds in military fashion,
ate breakfast, and lined up for roll call. they worked eleven and a half
hours with a lunch break. Ater, they went to bed to get up and do it all
over again.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jews who were killed there were burnt and used as fertilizers on the fields.
Small children, babies, and mothers, who were not able to work, were killed
immediately. Thirty to forty people a day were killed of phenol injections.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In late 1944, pit burning was the chief method of corpse disposal. They
poured alcohol, oil, and large quanties of boiling human fat on them to
keep them burning. Between 1939 to 1945 seventy or more medical experiments
were conducted. Out of the 405,000 that registered, 65,000 survived.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nazis tattooed the Jews with a special number on their left arm when they
arrived in the camps. They made them wear a six point star badge when they
were in the camps and before they came to the camps. Jews made them and
distributed them to all Jews in the area.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Women who arrived were put though total humiliation.&nbsp; If they had
small children they would be gassed with them. They were divided from the
men' s camps by a brick wall.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Auschwitz 1 could hold about 10,000 or more. It was built shortly after
the defeat of Poland. In 1947 Rololf Hoss was hanged there. The exact date
was April 7, 1947.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nazis used the" resettlement action " or the shortest time to exterminate
people with out much attention. Many Nazis used oven as part of their "resettlement
action plan" These ovens could kill 10,000 people in twenty- four hours.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The way the people got to the camp was on a freight train on tracks set
aside for just that. Jews were given no food or water for the four day,
three night trip. When they got to the camp they were split into two groups.
The Nazis only too the fittest.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Auschwitz diese could be caught almost anywhere, because it was so unsanitary.
A lot of people died because they caught dies.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Jester"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You have heard how awful these camps were and how those people suffered.
Now you know what life was like in Auschwitz 1.</font></font></font>
