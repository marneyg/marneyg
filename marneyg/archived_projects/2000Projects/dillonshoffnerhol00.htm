Austria, a small town across the Inn River&nbsp; from Germany.&nbsp; In

In 1920 Hitler joined the National Socialist German Workers Party, Better
known as the Nazis.&nbsp; Hitler became the leader of the Nazi party and
built up membership quickly, mostly because of his powerful speaking ability.&nbsp;
On November 9, 1923, Hitler led more than two- thousand storm troopers
on a march to seize the Bavarian government.&nbsp; The attempt failed and
Hitler was arrested and sentenced to prison for five years for treason.&nbsp;
in 1930 a worldwide depression hit Germany, yet Germany also had the dept
of payingfor the damage it had caused in World War 1.&nbsp; Hitler protested
againest paying the dept and said that the Jews and Communists were the
cause of Germanys defeat in the war.&nbsp;</font></font>

of all German-speaking peoples.&nbsp; Before Hitler was stopped in 1945
by the allied countries he had killed over 12 million people.&nbsp; Hitler
commited suicide in his bunker on April 30, 1945 and seven days later,
Germany surrendered.</font></font>

While Hitler was in prison in 1923, he wrote a book called Mein Kamph,
better known as My Struggle or My Battle.&nbsp; Under Hitler's government
there was no freedom.&nbsp; The government controlled every part of one's
life.&nbsp; Hitler used extensive propaganda to brainwash the nation into
believing his theory about creating Aryan or nordic race.</font></font></td>
