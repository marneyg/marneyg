Hitler's vision of horror was alive and well in Dachau: the barracks, the
ovens, the electrical barbed wire fences remained intact. Imagine this
if you will, a mound of 10,000 rotting corpses lie on one side of you while
on the other side is yet a mound of 12,000 more. The place was like hell
on earth. Waking up to the sickly smell of burning flesh and hair which
probably carried all the way to Munich with only the slightest breeze,
yet the villagers claimed they had no idea what was going on.</font></font></font></b>

Dachau concentration camp was the first concentration camp built in Germany.
On March 20, 1933, Henrich Himmler announced at a press conference the
establishment of Dachau concentration camp. The very next day the press
announced: "On Wednesday, the first concentration camp will be established
in the neighborhood of Dachau..." The camp was built to detain political
undesirables. The head commander of Dachau was Theodor Eiche under Henrich
Himmler's direction. Nobody knew that it would be the ideal training ground
of murder, that is for the SS. Dachau started because prisons were overflowing
with people the government didn't like. They had little money for another
prison so they built camps like Dachau. Dahcau is huge. It would take a
hour to walk all the way around the grounds. March 22,1933 marks the date
when the first prisoners were hauled in. On the way in they read the words
on the gate "ARBEIT MACHT FREI" which means work</font></font></font></b>

were murdered at Dachau, but an estimated 50,000 people perished unrecorded.
On the night of Kristallnacht more than 10,000 Jews arrived after being
arrested for so called crimes. What were their crimes? Having a religion
different than Hitler's.</font></font></font></b>

Life as a prisoner in the concentration camp began with the arrival at
the camp. The SS had a cruel ritual of their "welcome". They wanted to
make sure that they instilled fear and dread onto them and to make it clear
to their prisoners that their legal status was gone. More and more insults
were brought upon them: their remaining possessions were taken from them,
their hair was shaved off and they were put into different garments. They
all had a number and a colored triangle indicating which category they
belonged to. Their name and existence had disappeared, now they were just
another number. Their daily routine was filled with hard labor, hunger,
exhaustion, and fear of being beaten or even killed. Prisoners worked on
everything form basketry to wrought iron work. They also had to take care
of
the camp. While the camp was being enlarged from 1939-1940, prisoners had
to work extremely hard at an exhausting pace seven days a week to satisfy
the SS commanders. Prisoners were often pushed to their deaths deliberately.
Many prisoners fell victum to what is called "annihilation through work".</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1942 the main office of the SS economic section was told that they had
to have an inspection of the camp. The office tried to make certain improvements
in order the lower the high death rate. At the same time the systematic
killing of "inferior races" began in the extermination camps. The SS then
asked for as many save workers as possible so that they wouldn't get caught
for the mass extermination of the prisoners.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By the end of the war the SS behavior towards the prisoners lightened up
a little. The prisoners, weak and undernourished, had to work 11 hours
a day. The walk to and from work was often hard, so the prisoners got very
little sleep. Prisoners who fell ill were sent to the main camp, this usually
meant death. Prisoners often had very little or no money for the canteen
where in the first few years they were able to buy a few things, but of
course at very high prices. Hunger definitely played a huge role in the
daily struggle to stay alive.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There were many different kinds of punishments. Detention in the camp prison
was where they were chained to the wall without their rations. Particularly
favored punishments were the "punishment drills" which meant working during
their free time, or endless "roll calls". Every morning all the prisoners
had to form up in the square according to the barracks while there numbers
were called out. This usually lasted about an hour.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On January 23,1938, a prisoner escaped from the camp. the remaining prisoners
had to stand in the roll call square the whole night. It was snowing. Many
prisoners collapsed and died during the night.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The chief cause of death was disease, above all, typhus, a disease that
flourished here populations were crowded in places where health measures
were either unknown or had broken down.&nbsp; Sanitation in Germany was
at a low grade, the food supply and food distribution was poor. Most of
the thousands of people who died at Dachau wasn't because of Germans deliberately
starving their prisoners, but because of</font></font></font></b>

<td VALIGN=TOP><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+2>the
diseases.&nbsp; The SS did not want to finance the medical and nursing
care of the prisoners. The camp leader decided whether or not a prisoner
was sick and should be allowed to see a doctor.&nbsp; A prisoner was not
permitted to be</font></font></font></b></td>

from work until his temperature rose above 104F when he or she could no
longer stand up. With few exceptions the SS doctors did not treat the prisoners.
Many people were injured at work because of the absence of safety precautions.
This often led to crippling or death. In addition many prisoners suffered
frost bite in the winter because of the little clothing that they had.
In the summer, many suffered from working hours unprotected from the sun's
rays. In the last four months Proceeding the liberation of Dachau over
13,000 prisoners died.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Did gassing actually occur at Dachau? A US army photo depicts a GI looking
at a steel door marked with a skull and cross bones and the German words
for "Caution! Mortal Danger! Don't open!" The question is&nbsp;</font></font></font></b>

<td><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+2>still
around today, did prisoners at Dachau camp actually perish in the gas chambers?
Many think not. They believe that the first chamber was just a delousing
chamber for clothes. The second gas chamber is still uncertain, this one
was cunningly disguised as a shower room. Was this a room where thousands
breathed their last or not? While numerous reports on the function of the
shower heads, they still don't know. Were they dummies, or did the lethal
cyanide gas stream through them?</font></font></font></b></td>

During the last few weeks before the liberation, the prisoners had to live
under inhuman conditions, a condition to which they thought to be impossible.
The huge transports were continuously arriving from the camps. The allies
had found human beings who were reduced to a skeleton and exhausted from
death. From each railway carriage it was necessary to remove all the corpses
of those who had died en route. Daily over 100 people died of typhus which
had been an extreme problem since December 1944. There was little medicine
to help them so it was impossible the control the epidemic.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Every day the prisoners saw Allies, bombers in the sky, and yet they had
not bombed the town of Dachau. What was the SS going to do with the 30,000
prisoners? Were they planning to kill them all before the Allies could
come? After the war the answer turned out to be yes. They had planned to
kill the inmates of the concentration camp by bombs and poison. Himmler
had commanded that no prisoner would fall into the hands of the Allies,
and that the camp must be evacuated immediately. The prisoners who had
been working loosely together decided to organize an underground camp committee
to make sure they stayed alive and if necessary organize&nbsp; resistance
against the SS plans of action.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On April 26, the secret committee sent two prisoners from the camp and
find their way to the American troops whose approach could be heard by
the roar of the guns. They were to ask them to come to Dachau as soon as
possible. The prisoners were successful and two days later the Americans,
who had originally planned to capture Munich first, arrived in Dachau.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On that same day the SS plan went into action. The SS guards demanded that
7,000 prisoners walk south. The march was hard. Hundreds were shot as soon
as they could no longer walk. The American troops took over these columns
in the beginning of May. Only then did the SS guards start to fight. Only
two days before the liberation of the camp the innocent people fell victim
to their death.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On Sunday April 29, 1945 sporadic shots rang out. Shortly after, the words
"We are free!" resounded and spread throughout the camp like</font></font></font></b>
