Many historians believe the Battle of Gettysburg was a major turning point
in the Civil War.&nbsp; In this battle 20,000 Union and 18,000 Confederate
soldiers died. This battle was fought from July 1, to July3.</td>

General Robert E. Lee led the Confederate army of 75,000 men.&nbsp; After
the Battle of Chancellorsville, Lee decided to divide his army into three
corps.&nbsp; These three corps were commanded by three lieutenant generals:
James Longstreet, Richard Stoddert, and Ambrose Powell Hill</td>

<td>&nbsp;On July 1, 1863 the two armies met in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania
accidentally.&nbsp; Lee wanted to fight if he could get the North in a
vulnerable position.&nbsp; General James Longstreet disagreed with these
plans, but he was reassured when Lee told him that he’d let the North attack
first.&nbsp; The battle began when Hill’s division collided with a federal
cavalry division commanded by Major General John Buford.&nbsp; The fighting
went on endlessly until Ewell’s corps arrived.&nbsp; With their help, the
Confederates pushed the Union from forward positions to Culp’s Hill and
Cemetary Ridge southeast of Gettysburg.&nbsp; On that day 4,000 men were
taken prisoner by the South, and Federal General John Reynolds was killed.&nbsp;
The Federals captured Confederate General Archer who was the first Confederate
officer captured after Lee took over.</td>

around Culp’s Hill, Cemetary Ridge, Little Round Top, and Round Top.&nbsp;
The Confederates formed a long and thin line.&nbsp; They attacked the Federals,
but they were unable to make the North retreat. On the final day of the
battle, Lee decided to attack the North, despite what other generals thought.&nbsp;
Three Confederate divisions along with General George G. Pickett’s troops
charged onto Cemetary Ridge against Northern artillery and musket fire.&nbsp;
This famous charge is known as Pickett’s Charge.&nbsp; The Federals fell
back after losing three-fourths of their force.&nbsp;</td>

point in the Civil War because after this battle all of the fighting was
done in the South.&nbsp; The Union went on to win the Civil War, forcing
the southern states to stay with the Union.&nbsp; Their victory brought
equal rights to everyone.</td>
