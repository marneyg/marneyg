<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+2>&nbsp;Adolf Hitler
was born in Baunau am Inn, Austria-Hungary in 1889, the fourth child of
Klara and Alois Hitler. Hitler's father worked his considerable status,
this made Adolf Have a good childhood. Hitler began school in 1900 and
his grades were great. It was decided that he would go to Realschule, a
secondary school that prapared students for further study and emphesizid
languages and technical subjects. However, Hitler and his father strongly
argued over his career. His father wanted him to join the civil service
but instead of joining the civil service Hitler wanted to be an artist.
As a result Hitler did very poorly in Realschule having to repeat his first
year and proving there after. During his tine he began to work on his political
views. A strong sense of German nationalism the blessing of anti -semitism
and a distate for the ruling family and political structure of Austria-Hungary.
Hitler considered himself to be German. When his father died his whole
life changed. The survivor income was addequette to support hitlrer, his
mother, and his sister, but the absence of a dominate father figure altered
Hitlers position in the family.&nbsp; He spent alot of time playing and
dreaming, so he did poorley in his studies and left school entirearly.
In 1905 after the equilint of the ninth grade. Then Hitler moved to Vienna.
He had hoped to become an artist, but he was rejected as unqualified by
the academy of fine arts in 1907. His mother died in 1908. He pretended
to continue his studies in Vienna in order to recieve an orphans pension.
In reality he mostly wandered about the city admiring it's public buildings
and frequently attending operas especially those of Richard Wagner, who
Hitler liked alot because his heroic portrayles of German mytholigy when
he had exausted his inherited funds Hitler, unwilling to false a joy, he
ended up in a holmes shelter. While he was there Hitler was exposed to
extreme political ideas particularly the radical concept with Lanz von
Licbenfels. Licbenfels published a periodical about the supposed suppuriority
of Aryans an ill-defined race which included and the infurity of the other
race especially Jews. At the same time Hitler acquired a hatred for socialism
and came to invade the jews. Between 1910 and 1920 Hitlers life improved
when he began to paint and sell postcards and pictures for a living copying
fomous paintings, drawings, and famous buildings. He debated ideas with
others in the hostel, which he lived devoloping his public speaking&nbsp;
style. Failing to register himself to the draft in Austria led him to flee
to Munich, Germany in 1913 to escape authorities. He found he was unfit
to serve in the military. Then he returned to Munich. The outbreaks of
World War 1 in 1914 came as an oppertunity for Hitler, as his money was
running out. Then he volenteered for the Bauania unit in the German Army
and served the whole war through repetedly decorated for bravery but never
got promoted past a private first class. In war of very high insultes this
is diffuclet to explain. Perhaps officers consider him a loner who could
carry messages&nbsp; and perform other dangerous duties but who was unsatisfied
to command them.&nbsp; Hitler saw warfare as aform of the struggle for
survival among races a struggle that he was coming to see as the essence
of existance. At the anti- semitism feelings were growing extreme. When
Germany was defeated in 1918. Hitler was lying in the hospital suffering
temperary blindness, possibly caused by poison gas. He decided that Germany's
loss was the Jews fault. Hitler returned to Munich and was elected a political
speaker by the army headquarters, if he took up training. He had great
succes speaking. And Germany was even happier when he invented the swastika.
After a while he joined the NSDAP (National Socilest German Workers Party)
Also known as Nazi Party. He found anoutlet for his talent. After a while
he became the spokesman for the party. He had great talent. It only had
100 to 200 when he joined. By Feb. 1920 there were almost 2000 present.
After a while his speeches were growing weaker. Hitler grew very angry,
because some Jews were surviving death camps. Hitler decided to kill them
by a gas called Zyklon B. But People grew angry. So Hitler decided to committ
suicide. He killed over 1 millon people.</font></font></b>
