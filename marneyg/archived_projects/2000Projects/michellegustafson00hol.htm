Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau, Austria April 20, 1889.&nbsp; His mother
and father died and he became an orphan.&nbsp; In 1905 at the age of 16
he quit High school.&nbsp; October, 1907 at the age of 19 he left home
to go to Vienna.&nbsp; On May 1913 at the age of 25 he had left Vienna
to go to Munich.</font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Jester"><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When war broke out in August 1914 when Hitler was 26, he joined Sixteenth
Bavarian Infantry Regiment.&nbsp; April 1920 he went to work full time
at a party that was renamed National Socialist German Workers that you
probable know&nbsp; as a Nazi party.&nbsp; There are still Nazi parties
today.</font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Jester"><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
November 1923 - Several weeks before Joseph Goebbels was appointed the
Minister of People's Enlightenment and Propaganda, Hitler was named chancellor
of the new authoritarian regime.&nbsp; Hitler was a highly skilled orator
that spoke at the mass rallies.&nbsp; Hitler thought people were most suggestible
and least resistant.</font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Jester"><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hitler's philosophy about terror and was clear cut -</font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Jester"><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
''We must be ruthless.... Only thus shall we purge (give) our people of
their softness.... and their degenerate delight in beer - swilling....
I don't want the concentration camps transformed into penitentiaries.&nbsp;
Terror is the most effective political instrument .... It is my duty to
make use of every means of training the German people to cruelty and to
prepare them for war.... There must be no weakness or tenderness!''</font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Jester"><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hitler did NOT like Jews so he sat up concentration camps to kill all of
the Jews.&nbsp; Hitler said ''THERE MUST BE TOTAL REMOVAL OF THE JEWS!''</font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Jester"><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some people ask why do Germans listen to Hitler?&nbsp; Well most Germans
were scared of him and were afraid that Hitler would have the Nazis come
and kill them!</font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Jester"><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Nazis respected Hitler, so they would salute him with their right arm
held out at a strait angle.&nbsp; They used it as a greeting witch meant
''hail'' witch is translated as ''saved'' or ''healed.'' When Hitler became
leader of the Nazis the the greeting became ''Hail Hitler''&nbsp;</font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Jester"><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hitler had married to a young lady named Eva Braun who he had died with.&nbsp;
On April 29, 1945 3:25 p.m. Hitler gave his will to his secretary (Frau
Sertrud Junge).&nbsp; Hitler married Eva Braun 1hr. before they died together.</font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Jester"><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is all I got on Hitler's will it said-</font></font></font></i></b>
<br><b><i><font face="Jester"><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>''As
I did not consider that I could take responsibility during the years of
a struggle of my earthly career to take as my wife that girl who....''</font></font></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font face="Jester"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</font><font size=+2>The next day on April 30, 1945 3:30 p.m. Adolf Hitler
killed his wife Eva Braun then committed suicide.&nbsp; Today people still
fallow Hitler in Nazi parties.</font></font></font></i></b>
