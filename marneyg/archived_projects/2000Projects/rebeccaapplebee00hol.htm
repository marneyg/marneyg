Many ghettos were established throughout Germany and then the rest of Europe
close to Germany.&nbsp; The ghettos were the best living environment; not
anything I would choose.&nbsp; They were where Jews were littlertly squeezed
into small parts of the counties.&nbsp; They were very unhealthy .&nbsp;
People died of starvation, ideas, the cold, and deportation.&nbsp; The
first ghetto was established in Rome, Italy in 1555.&nbsp; So, the ghettos
were forced time after time.&nbsp; One example of these horrible , unfit
for the living ghettos is the Warsaw Ghettos.</font></font></font>

The Warsaw Ghettos carried about sixty thousand Jews in 1943 (half a million
Jew all together behind the walls of the ghettos).&nbsp; The first sign
of resistance flared up in January of 1943.&nbsp; WHen the Nazis began
their annihilation of the Warsaw ghetto, it forced the enemy into retreated
temporary abandonment of their&nbsp; aim.&nbsp; Another attempt was at
Extermination commenced on April 19th of 1934 and resulted in the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising.</font></font></font></td>

The Nazis invaded the Warsaw ghetto to get more Jews to send to concentration
camps and death camps.&nbsp; But, instead of leaving with Jews, the left
with dead Germans.&nbsp; The Nazis had entered , meeting a resistance,&nbsp;
Molotov coctails (a bottle full of gasoline with a burning rag in the top;
when it hit the ground, it exploded) and bullets from the few firearms
that were smuggled in by Jews.&nbsp; Twenty S.S. soldiers were killed.&nbsp;
About three hundred Germany were killed and one thousand wounded.&nbsp;
Warsaw, with almost sixty thoundsand Jews, facing three thousand germans
troops with seven thousand german reinforcements ready to fight.&nbsp;
General Himmler promised Hitler that the Warsaw ghetto would be distorted
within three days,&nbsp; It took them four weeks to majority reduce the
population; by killing.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Storybook"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Warsaw ghetto was dissolved into rubble, bomber attacks, gas attacks,
and burning every structure in sight.&nbsp; 15,000 Jews died in the battle,
but the Nazis still were satisfied.&nbsp; Most of the remaining Jews were
sent to death camps.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
