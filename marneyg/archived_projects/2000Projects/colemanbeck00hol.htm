</font><font size=+2>Elie
Wiesel is probably the most famous survivor of the Holocaust.&nbsp; He
was born on September 30, 1928 in Sighet, Romania.&nbsp; In 1944, the Jewish
community that Elie had grown up in was forced into ghettos by the Nazis
and later they were deported to the death Auschwitz-Birkeneau.&nbsp; Wiesel's
mother and sister were sent to the gas chambers.&nbsp; He was not selected
so he stayed and did forced labor.&nbsp; Wiesel never wrote any stories
while at the death camp.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was hoping he would be able to
make it through the war in the death camps.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wiesel was only fifteen years old when he and his family were sent to the
death camps.&nbsp; Wiesel would spend the remainder of the war in the camps
of Auschwitz, Buna, and Bergen Belsen camps.&nbsp; When the war was over,
Wiesel was hospitalized for many weeks because he had severe malnutrition
but a Norwegian doctor kept him alive.&nbsp; After recovering, he resumed
his education.&nbsp; After Wiesel's Holocaust experience, he promised himself
not to speak of his Holocaust experience for ten years.&nbsp; An older
author convinced Wiesel to tell his story.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After that, Wiesel wrote an eight hundred page manuscript in Yiddish on
his Holocaust experience.&nbsp; This book was called Night, his most famous
book on the Jews and their Holocaust experiences.&nbsp; When Night was
published he then wrote two other very famous books called Dawn, and The
Gates of the&nbsp; Forest.&nbsp; These books were called Wiesel's trilogy.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One of Wiesel's famous quotes is '' to remain silent and indifferent is
the greatest sin of all.''&nbsp; Wiesel is the conscience of his generation
with no question.&nbsp; Wiesel was the leader of the Jews.&nbsp; Another
one of his famous quotes is '' no one has the right to speak for the dead.''&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wiesel has written nearly three dozen books dealing with Judaism, the Holocaust,
and the responsibility to fight hatred, racism, and genocide.&nbsp; He
is a very religious man.&nbsp; Elie Wiesel is very important because he
spoke about the hard experiences that many Jews couldn't do.&nbsp; The
book, All Rivers Run to Sea is the first book that puts the events of his
life in comprehensive perspective.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1956 Wiesel made a decision to become a U. S.&nbsp; citizen.&nbsp; In
1978, Wiesel was appointed Chairman of the United States Holocaust Memorial
by President Jimmy Carter.&nbsp; Elie Wiesel is famous because of his writing
and surviving the Holocaust.&nbsp; He is a great author and a writing genious.&nbsp;
In 1985, Wiesel was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal of Achievement.&nbsp;
He is considered the leading voice of all the survivors.&nbsp; His books
describe the Holocaust and tell of some of the horrors that he witnessed
at the death camps.&nbsp; Most of his books are different in at least one
way.&nbsp; He believes that the survivors will always suffer because of
the indifference of the world.&nbsp; One of the lessons of his writings
teaches people '' to distinguish between what we need to understand and
what we should not attempt.''&nbsp; Night was his most famous book because
it penetrated inside experiences of Jews within the concentration camps.&nbsp;
Since 1976, Wiesel has been the Andrew Mellon Professor of Humanities at
Boston University.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wiesel's stories will help young children that are Jews understand what
has happened in their heritage and many of their ancestors.&nbsp; Elie
Wiesel stated that there is a '' need to lay the sufficient blame on the
world of the living, as a kind of penance for the dead, a world that then
as now never acknowledged its portion of responsibility.''&nbsp; Elie Wiesel
was a teacher to many and also just a writer to many, but to the Jews he
was both.&nbsp; He taught them to speak of their experiences and let their
emotions of this tragic situation our.&nbsp; He also taught them to stand
up for themselves.&nbsp; This is why in 1986, Elie Wiesel won the Nobel
Peace Prize.&nbsp; As of right now, Wiesel lives in New York City with
his wife and son, and he continues to write and speak around the world.</font></font></font>
