wooden and brick barracks. It would hold up to 100,000 inmates. This camp
was equipped with crematories II-V and gas chambers. According to SS notes

of revolts like this, prisoners were severally punished. According to Boris
Weinberg, SS master sergeant Max Bialas, was stabbed by an inmate who jumped
out of line. The inmate was hit over the head with a shovel, and guards
started shooting into the crowed. Ten people were to be picked at random
and shot in front of the roll call. Instead 150 men were taken to the ditches
and shot.</font></font></font></td>

Not only were Jews admitted into Auschwitz. Also Gypsies, many Gypsies
came from the same origin as the Nazis. This caused a problem for Hitler's
master race. With them in Germany they could not run it. Because the Gypsies
were nomadic , they were not kept in records, therefore we don't know how
many were killed in the death camps.</font></font></font></td>

the prisoners were scared to be in Auschwitz, the trip there was more than
most could handle. They were either marched or transported by train. Most
trains could carry 1,450 people. The journeys took at least three nights
and four days. On these trains prisoners got no food (except what they
could brought themselves), no water, or rest rooms.</font></font></td>

burn up to three bodies per chamber. This meant they could burn 360 bodies
per operation, 720 per hour, and 17,280 per shift. Because the shifts ran
all day and all night they could burn over 24,000 bodies. In the months
of May-July of 1944 over 1,314,000 bodies were burned.</font></font></td>

came up with a new method of working forces. They would pick the fittest
men and put them to work. These people were picked by age, trade, and physical
feature. After being chose they were registered and tattooed. Josef Mengele,
a sadistic German physician, met prisoners upon arrival deciding who would
live an who would die. He did many expirements at Auschwitz.&nbsp;</font></font></td>
