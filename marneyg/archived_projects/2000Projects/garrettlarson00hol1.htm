Experiments were designed to support Nazi theories of racial superiority.&nbsp;
Mengele was intrigued by the number of soviet prisoners who looked more
like the ideal German. When he found suitable subjects from which to take
skull measurements, he simply had them shot and their heads cut off.&nbsp;
He tried to find ways to turn brown eyes to blue by injecting them with
various pigments.&nbsp; A visitor to his lab was aghast to see a collection
of eyes pinned to a board. "They were pinned up like butterflies,"&nbsp;
she said. "I thought I was dead and already living in hell."</font></font></font>

Mengele's greatest interest was twins.&nbsp; He thought that if he could
discover what caused twin birth, He could use the knowledge to increase
the birthrate of Germans.&nbsp; When transports arrived he quickly along
the ranks of people wait for the selection shouting "Zwillinge aus!" Twins
out!"&nbsp; Mengele also had troops on the look out for any deformations
on a person.</font></font></font>
