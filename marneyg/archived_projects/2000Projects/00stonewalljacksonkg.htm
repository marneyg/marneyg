<td>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson was born on January 21, 1824
in the town of Clarksburg, Virginia.&nbsp; His mom and dad died when he
was only three years old.&nbsp; After school he wanted more schooling so
he decided that he wanted to go to the US Military Academy at West Point.&nbsp;
He thought that the easiest way to get in was to ask the President of the
United States of America.&nbsp; He walked from Virginia to Washington D.C.&nbsp;
He couldn’t see the President so he talked to the secretary and he granted
him an appointment with the Academy.&nbsp; They taught him about war stradegy,
weapons and battle tactics.&nbsp; After he graduated he went straight into
the US Army as a lieutenant.&nbsp; His first command was in the Mexico
War.&nbsp; In 1847 they got Mexico to add Texas, California, and&nbsp;
<br>New Mexico to the United States. He resigned from the army in 1851
to teach at Virginia Military Institute.&nbsp; He there for ten years and
during then his wife died so he re-married.&nbsp; His new wife was a god
fearing women, so he became a Presbyterian and his friends called him “Deacon
Jackson”.&nbsp; When the Crises between the North and the South arose he
wanted to see the preserved, but he also believed the south had a just
cause.&nbsp; So, he joined the Confederate army as a colonel.&nbsp; Next
at Bull Run he was in command of Company K, 5th Virginia Regiment, C.S.A
and they were on the left flank-Henry House hill.&nbsp; "Stonewall" said,
that the yankee General Pope thought that he could whoop the confederates,
but the confederates held there ground and held them like a "Stonewall".&nbsp;
After the war ended pepole started calling him&nbsp;
<br>"Stonewall Jackson".&nbsp; After a while he decided that he consider
the name a badge of honor. At the Second Bull Run General Lee gave "Stonewall"
the honor of commanding one of the most powerful forces in opposition to
the Union, it was the Confederate Army from Northern Virginia.&nbsp; He
died in May of 1963.</td>
