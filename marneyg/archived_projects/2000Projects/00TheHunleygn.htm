one of the nine men selected to be on board the first submarine used in
battle?&nbsp; On February 17, 1864 the men set out for the Union Navy’s
biggest ship,&nbsp; which was just outside of Charleston Harbor.</font></td>

destination they spotted a lookout on board, which didn’t have the slightest
chance of knowing what was coming.&nbsp; Then an alarm rang out this was
definitely no porpoise or debris floating.&nbsp; An object that was 39
feet 5inches long and 3feet 10 inches wide was heading straight for the
Warship Housatonic.&nbsp; It was different; as the Union sailors began
firing at the Hunley bullets ricocheted off of its iron structure.</font></td>

<tr>
<td><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside the Hunley 8 men
poured in sweat over hand cranks that powered the propeller while their
captain manned the dive planes.&nbsp; The bullets from the Housatonic were
no match for what was going to be fired at them, a 135 pound torpedo.&nbsp;
At 9:00 P.M. the Housatonic was struck with an explosion that destroyed
its entire stern.&nbsp; The Hunley was the first submarine to ever sink
an enemy ship, but the Hunley had also made its last attack.&nbsp; The
submarine and its crew of nine went down with the Housatonic.</font></td>

had back in 1864 wasn’t all that great.&nbsp; The technology back then
wasn’t all that great.&nbsp; They didn’t have bathrooms indoors, running
water, or even electricity in homes.&nbsp; For the Confederates to come
up with the idea to send nine men under water, in a submarine to fight
in battle is truly amazing.</font></td>
