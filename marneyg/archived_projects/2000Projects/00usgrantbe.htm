February 29, 1864, Ulysses S. Grant was appointed General-in-Chief of the
Union Army, and the war is starting over.&nbsp; As soon as Grant received
the news, he met with General Sherman.&nbsp; Grant’s plan was that Sherman
would go after Joe Johnston while he would go after Robert E. Lee, the
General of the Confederates. Grant once said: “The art of war is simple
enough. Find out where your enemy is. Get at him as soon as you can. Strike
at him as hard as you can and as often as you can, and keep moving on.”
Grant’s strategy was different from all the others. He believed the Union
should focus on the Confederate army and not the Confederate capital.</font></font></td>

Grant marched passed the Ripidan River he met Lee in Virginia in the battle
called <a href="00usgrant1be.htm">The Wilderness</a>. After two days of
long fighting Lee was able to stop Grant's offensive charge, but Grant
decided to slip out and move south.&nbsp; The total killed was 2,246, and
it didn't matter to Grant and the Union Army moved on.&nbsp; Grant and
Lee meet again at Spotsylvania. During the first phase Colonel Upton, a
Union commander, tried to penetrate the Confederates, but failed.&nbsp;
Grant was attempting to find the flanks of the Confederates. Lee stopped
him again. Union Losses were huge 14,267. Once again it didn't stop the
Union from moving on.&nbsp;</font></font></td>

Stuart was wounded and could not continue.&nbsp; On May 23rd Grant arrived
at Totpotomy Creek and Lee wasted no time in attacking. However, Grant
was able to escape and move south.</font></font></td>
