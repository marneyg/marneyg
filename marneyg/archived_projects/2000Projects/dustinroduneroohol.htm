<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Chaucer">&nbsp;</font> <font size=+1>Adolf
Eichmann is the son of Adolf Karl Eichmann and Marie Nee Schefferling.
Adolf Eichmann was born in a town called Solingen, Germany in March 19,
1906. His parents were also protestants. When Adolf Eichmann was eight
years old him and his parents moved to Linz, Austria. When Adolf was in
school he was medicre, if not poor, student. His father Adolf Karl Eichmann
was the commercial manager of the Linz Electric Works, and the family goes
to church every Sunday.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When his mother died he was ten
years old, and his dad soon remarried. He had one sister and five brothers.
Years later, Adolf told the Dutch interviewer, Wilhelm Sassen, which whom
he was collabrating a book of his experience, his friend, Harry Sellar,
which was Jewish.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dropping out of high school,
he became a travel salesman with the Socony Vacuum Company.&nbsp; Later,
he took a job with an AmericanOil Company, and this gave him an opportunity
to travel.&nbsp; In 1932, Eichmann and his father were invited to a meeting
of the Nazi Party by a family friend, Dr. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Eichmann
was entranced by the percuting nationalistic fervor of those who attended,
and he signed up. A year later, he was laid off from his oil company job
and sought help from Kaltenbrunner. Kaltenbrunner arranged for Eichmann
to be accepted into the S.S. brigade comprised of Austrians. Soon thereafter,
Eichmann was invited to join the S.D., the S.S.'s Security Service and
given rank of sergent. In 1935 Adolf was assigned to the Jewish Departmant
of the S.D. and worked his way to the top. Unlike virtually all the Nazi
bureaucrates, who were related among departmant, Eichmann kept the same
post throughout the war.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He taught himself Hebreew
and Yiddish. He studied the Jews, Gathering information about their leaders,
Synogogues, Business, culture. Eichmann soon married Vera Liebe, a native
of Bohemia in 1936 and lived with her Prague. He became the father of four
children, all boys.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was given his
military comission in 1937, Beggining with the rank of second Lieutenant.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Austria was annexed
by Germany on March 13 1938. Riehard Heydrich, chief of the S.D., was given
the responsibility of clearing Germany and its allies of Jews. Adolf arrived
in Vienna on March 17,and, as in Jewishs Affairs who had even been to Palestine,
soon given the job of expelling the Jewish community. A special authority
was set under Heydrich called the Central Office for Jewish Emigration,
with Eichmann in charge. His strategy was to reopen Jewish institution,
but only for the purpose of assisting him in deportations. He arranged
for the Jewish Leaers in concentration camp to be returned to Vienna to
staff these offices to assist him in deportations. He set upon assembly
line in which Jews would go in and at the other end, they were stripped
of there property, bank accounts, jobs, apartments,and given a passport
valid for two weeks. If they did find a foreign visa, they would be sent
to Dachau, a prison camp near Munich for political opponents of the Nazi
regime.</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;By the time war broke out in September 1939, Eichmann
was running the Central Office for Jewish Emigration with three branch
offices. He was promoted almost annually, eventually achieving the rank
of Lt. Colonel of the S.S. by 1941.</font>
