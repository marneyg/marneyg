Ironclad Board placed ads in Northern Newspapers inviting designers to
submit their plans for the construction of ironclad warships.&nbsp; In
a letter to Abraham Lincoln dated August 29, 1861 John Ericsson offered
to build a vessel, “…that within ten weeks after commencing the structure
I would engage to be ready to take up position under the Rebel guns at
Norfolk…”&nbsp; Ericsson was a Swedish-American inventor that designed
the Union Monitor nicknamed “cheese box on a raft.’</font>

renamed the ship Virginia, although I’ll be using Merrimack by which it
is better known.</font>

by a storm. Two days later on March 8, 1862 naval history was made.&nbsp;
The first Confederate ironclad steamed down the Elizabeth River into Hampton
Roads to attack the U.S. blockade.&nbsp; The Merrimack first headed toward
a twenty-four-gun wooden hulled steam-sailing slope, Cumberland.&nbsp;
After ramming and sinking the Cumberland the Merrimack headed for the Congress,
a fifty-gun frigate.&nbsp; An awestruck Union officer watched the fight
as the Merrimack fired “shot and shell into her with terrific effect, while
the shot form the Congress glanced from her iron-plated sloping sides without
doing any apparent injury.”&nbsp; After the first day the Confederates
were leading 2-0 proving iron superior to wood.</font></td>

for day two of fighting, it found a Union ship called the Monitor waiting
for it.&nbsp; The Confederate ironclad carried more guns than the Monitor,
but it was slow, clumsy, and prone to engine trouble.&nbsp; The Union Monitor
was the faster and more maneuverable ironclad, but it lacked the Rebel
vessel’s brutish size and power.&nbsp; Lieutenant S. Dana Greene, an officer
aboard the Monitor described the first exchange of gunfire: “The turrets
and other parts were heavily struck, but the shots did not penetrate; the
tower was intact, and it continued to revolve.</font></td>
