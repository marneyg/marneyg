in Richmond, Lee headed north, crossing the Potomac.&nbsp; He was soon
forced to confront a problem that would play a major role in the campaign.&nbsp;
Thousands of tired soldiers had fallen behind their regiment, and were
trailing the army.&nbsp; To prevent their certain capture if they crossed
the river they were directed west to Winchester.&nbsp; Lee was going to
face the enemy without full force, because so many just dropped out of
the ranks, cause they did not to attack northern homes.</font>

pick George McClellan as general.&nbsp; McClellan left with two beat-up

was in Frederick where he issued Special Orders 191 to his commanders.&nbsp;
They directed Jackson to take his three divisions west, and cross the Potomac.&nbsp;
As McClellan entered Frederick on the same day, in a stroke of luck some
of his men found a copy of Special Orders 191.&nbsp; He now knew how he
could relieve Harpers Ferry and defeat Lee’s army piece by piece.&nbsp;
The next day he would attack Lee at South Mountain</font></td>

make his stand outside of Sharpsburg, Maryland.&nbsp; With the Potomac
only a mile to his rear.&nbsp; Lee’s army was small only about 26,000 men
against 70,000 men of the Union Army of the Potomac.&nbsp; Lee would half
to wait for the remainder of Jackson’s army to come if he wanted to make
a stand.&nbsp; Lee was unable to prevent McClellan from crossing Antietam
Creek.&nbsp; So Lee settled on a defensive posture along the ridge lines
to the north and east of town.&nbsp; Jackson’s Corps occupied the ground
north of town.&nbsp; Hooker’s 1 Corps crossed Antietam Creek via the Upper
Bridge.&nbsp; Longstreet’s Corps stretched from northeast of town and southeast
