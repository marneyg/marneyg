<p><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My report
is on Adolf Hitler who was definitely the bad guy of World</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>War II.&nbsp; Adolf Hitler was
born in Braunau, Austria on April 20, 1889.&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>Braunau was a small town across
the Inn River from Germany.&nbsp; After Hitler was born, Hitler's dad and
him moved to Linz, Austria where he attended school. Hitler was a very
poor student in High School which was blamed on his&nbsp; teachers.&nbsp;
This angered Hitler's father because he wanted Hitler to become a government
worker as he had been.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adolf
Hitler wanted to be an artist so in 1907, Hitler moved to Vienna, Austria
to fulfill his dream of being an artist.&nbsp; This attempt ended when
Hitler failed the entrance exam to the Academy of Fine Arts.&nbsp; (Darn
maybe he wouldn't of killed millions of people and started World War II
if he would of been an artist).&nbsp; Hitler's mother died in 1907 but
he decided to remain in Vienna.&nbsp; He failed the same exam a year later.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hitler
didn't have a steady job in Vienna ,but instead, he did have many odd jobs.&nbsp;
In Vienna Hitler lived in a cheap rooming house or slept on park benches.&nbsp;
He often got meals from charity kitchens.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While
Hitler was in Vienna he learned to hate non-Germans.&nbsp; He spoke German
and considered himself German.&nbsp; He believed no government could last
if they treated all ethnic groups equally.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
1913 Adolf Hitler moved to Munich, Germany.&nbsp; When World War II broke
out he volunteered for service in the German army.&nbsp; He was twice dedicated
for bravery but only managed to become corporal.&nbsp; In a battle Hitler
was temporarily blinded from poisonous gas.&nbsp; While Hitler was in the
hospital recovering someone came and told him Germany surrendered.&nbsp;
He thought Germany could of won, and that they were betrayed by politicians
and Jews.&nbsp; That's when he decided to go into politics.&nbsp; He already
had hatred for Jews, now it was huge.&nbsp; He promised to rid Germany
of Jews and Communists forever and to reunite German speaking Europe.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
1920 Hitler joined the National Socialist German Workers Party</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>known as the Nazis.&nbsp; They
called for all Germans even ones in other</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>countries to unite into one
nation; they wanted a strong central government, and for the cancellation
of the Versailles Treaty.&nbsp; The Treaty put Germany in a big hole because
after World War I Germany had to pay reparations to all the other countries
involved in the War to pay for their equipment, etc.&nbsp; Hitler quickly
became leader of the Nazis Party, and built up membership quickly, mostly
because of his good speaking ability.&nbsp; Hitler organized an army for
the Nazis Party known as the Storm Troopers "Brown Shirts".&nbsp; They
were called for to fight groups seeking to disband the Nazi Rallies.&nbsp;
On November 19, 1923 Hitler led more than 2,000 Storm Troopers on a march
to seize the Bavarian government.&nbsp; The attempt failed and Hitler was
sent to prison for five years for treason. Hitler wrote Mein Kampf (My
Struggle) while in prison.&nbsp; After nine months he was released and
immediately began to build up the Nazis Party again.&nbsp; He set up a
private battle-ready elite called Schutzstaffell or also known as the S.S.&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By
1929 the Nazis were an important minor political party. On January 30,
1933 President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler chancellor of
Germany.&nbsp; Hindenburg died in 1934 but Hitler already had control of
Germany.&nbsp; Hitler gave himself the title "Fuehrur" (leader).&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>When Hitler gained control he
used extensive propaganda to brainwash</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>the nation into believing about
creating the perfect Aryan or Nordic race.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>Hitler planned to rid Germany
of Jews, Gypsies, Negroes, handicapped, and mentally ill persons.&nbsp;
It was called the Final Solution.&nbsp; Hitler even killed Christians that
had "Impure blood" (a Jew in their family tree).&nbsp; Hitler might of
had a Jewish grandfather but that side of his family is unclear.&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
reason Hitler hated Jews so much is when he was in Vienna he read Anti-Semitic
literature much of which reviled Jews in sordid, pornographic terms.&nbsp;
He came to believe that Jews were at the bottom of everything wrong with
society.&nbsp; He thought the Jews wanted to destroy the Aryan race and
take over the world.&nbsp; So when he became chancellor he began hoarding
out Jews and later began to execute them.&nbsp;</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hitler
killed himself on April 30, 1945 because the Allies were</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>advancing and he knew they were
probably going to lose the war.&nbsp; Hitler's bunker was just recently
found in Berlin under the garden of Reichskanzle.&nbsp; It was found while
doing work to Pink Floyd's(The Wall).&nbsp; It was hard to find because
the garden was torn down by the Russians after World War II.</font></font></b>
