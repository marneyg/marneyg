  September 8, 1828 in a cottage near Brewer, Maine; a farming and shipbuilding
  community. He was named after James Lawrence who said the famous words &#8220;don't
  give up the ship.&#8221; He was the eldest of five children who were raised on good
  manners and cheerfulness. As a boy he loved the outdoors and as a adolescence
  loved school and mathematics and reading. When he was with his father he
  learned many lessons such as how to have sheer willpower and a positive
  attitude that would later help him in life.</span></p>

  decided to enter Bowdoin College at Brunswick. There he began using Joshua as
  is first name. Throughout his first two years there he was a quiet boy who
  most of the time kept to himself, but his third year he began to become very
  active and even decided to join the drama club. He also decided to enter into
  oratory and composition. As a student he earned a reputation for standing
  behind his principles even when challenged by authorities. There he also
  began to earn a sense of humor, which also helped his reputation. When not
  pursuing his studies he enjoyed singing and playing the bass violin, which
  was self taught.</span></p>

  Betta Kappa&nbsp; with a bachelors degree. It was not until late 1855 they
  would get married. In 1856 he was elected chair of modern languages and
  professor of rhetoric and oratory. While being a professor in his early years

  Infantry. As a trainee at a camp he observed many lessons about soldiering
  and being in charge of a regiment. He also witnessed the transformation of
  more than 900 unskilled men into soldiers. The first order for the new
  Lieutenant was to travel to Antietam, the bloodiest battle of all time, but
  luckily they wouldn't fight until halfway through the battle. Their second
  battle would be &#8220;The Battle of Fredricksburg&#8221; one in which he was shot for
  the first in the neck and in the ear, but months later would make a
  remarkable comeback.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt;color:#3366FF'>&nbsp; In the
  Battle at Gettysburg, which would prove to be his finest hour and battle, he
  was ranked a general. On July 2, 1863 his 20th Maine Infantry was positioned
  at the far left of the line on &#8220;Little Round Top&#8221;. In a Confederate to claim
  &#8220;Little Round Top&#8221; General John Bell Hood tried to advance up a rocky hill.
  In a counterattack Chamberlain's infantry charged down the hill while
  Chamberlain himself held the top of &#8220;Little Round Top.&#8221; He would many years
  later receive many honors for his heroics including a medal of honor. Not
  long after Gettysburg he was sent to the &#8220;Battle of Spotsylvania&#8221; the last
  time he would command the 20th Maine Infantry another victory. The fourth war
  he would fight in was &quot;The Battle Petersburg&quot; where he was shot
  with the a minee ball again he soon recovered. In 1865 he was sent to Quaker
  Ridge and was shot in the arm. On April 9, 1865 Chamberlain was called on by
  Grant to receive the formal surrender of arms and colors of Lee's Confederate
  army at Appomattox Courthouse. At Appomattox he was reunited for the first
  time with his old 20th Maine Infantry. Years later after the war in 1866 he
  became a professor at Bowdein College. In 1871 he got into politics and was
  elected governor of&nbsp; Maine where he completed his four terms. On
  February 24, 1914 Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain passed away from an ancient
  gunshot wound that was believed he received at Petersburg. He was 86 years
  old.&nbsp;</span> </p>
