      suffrage leader was
      Virginia Louisa Minor. She was born on March 27, 1824, in Virginia. She
      married Francis Minor and then settled in&nbsp; St. Louis, Missouri. All her life
      she was an active leader in groups. When the Civil War
      began she became a member of the St. Louis Ladies Aid Society. Around 1865,
      she was the first woman to suggest that women should have the right to
      vote. Then in 1867 she became president of the Woman Suffrage Association
      of Missouri. In 1869, she proposed that the 14th Amendment to the
      Constitution guaranteed equal rights to women. She didn't
      think it was right that women couldn't vote. In October 1872 she tried
      to register to vote in St. Louis. When they said she couldn't, she brought a
      suit against them. The Minor vs. Happersett case was appealed all the way to
      the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, the appeal was lost. In one way, however it
      wasn't lost, because it finally attracted attention for women suffrage.
      Virginia Minor died due to health reasons in St. Louis, Missouri on Aug. 14, 1894,
      but is remembered by many, as a leading woman for women suffrage.</font> </font> </td>

      Most people only think of individual suffragists when they think of fighting for women suffrage, but there were
      two main groups of women that helped women finally get to vote. One group
      was the National Woman Suffrage Association. This group was founded by
      Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton on May 15, 1869, in New York.
      Stanton was the groups first President , while Anthony was the groups first
      Vice-President. They focused on getting women's suffrage state by state
      and worked to get working women into labor unions. The second group was led
      by Lucy Stone and her husband Henry Blackwell. This group was called
      &quot;American Woman Suffrage Association.&quot; This second group was more
      conservative, while the first group was more radical. The American Woman
      Suffrage Association also wanted to
      get individual states to allow women to vote. Eventually these two groups united,
      in 1890, to form the &quot;National American Woman Suffrage
      Association.&quot; This group combined all of their ideas into one. The
      group</font></font><font color="#0000FF"> still went state by state to win

      National American Woman Suffrage Association went off to form the National
      Woman's Party with Alice Paul. They worked to get Congress to pass a
      constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote. Paul led parades
      around the White House in this movement. They finally convinced Congress
      in 1919 and Congress approved the 19th Amendment, granting equal suffrage
      to women. Then it won ratification by least 36 to 48 states, and the House
      ratified it by only two votes. One of these votes was made by Harry Burn,
      but his district opposed ratification. However, Burn went by what his
      mother had told him to do which was &quot;Don't forget to be a good son
      and help Mrs.Catt.&quot; Congress ended up passing it on June 4, 1919, and
      it was ratified August 18, 1920. The 19th Amendment read like this:</font>
