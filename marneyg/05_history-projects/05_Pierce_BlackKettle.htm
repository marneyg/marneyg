    <td width="100%">Black Kettle had been a great warrior in his youth. Now, at
      middle age, he was widely known as chief of southern Cheyenne. Accompanied
      by Lean Bear, he had recently been to Washington and shook hands with the
      great father Lincoln. Lean Bear and Black Kettle must have had their minds
      blown seeing the Capitol. It is easy to see them in the middle of hustle
      and bustle thinking, &quot; What are these Whites doing?&quot;.

          <td width="100%">President Lincoln gave them medals and papers saying
            they were friends of the United States. But since then, there was
            rumor that soldiers would attack the Cheyenne. On one morning, Lean
            Bear saw soldiers approaching the camp. He grabbed the papers he
            received from Lincoln and rode out to meet them. As soon as he was
            close enough, they shot at him. Black Kettle didn't understand this.
            Black Kettle tried to avoid buffalo hunters, stage roads, railroads
            and forts. </td>

    <td width="100%">Cheyenne warriors, young men who created the Dog soldiers,
      were attracted to leaders like Roman Nose who loved a good fight,
      especially if there was a noble cause. As things got crazier on the
      plains, indiscriminate attacks became mutual fare. The Dog soldiers
      believed they could realize their ends through armed struggle.

            inexorable advance of the whites across the Great Plains. In 1864,
            officials in Colorado issued an ultimatum. All friendly Indians will
            report to local forts and surrender to be protected. Hostiles will
            be shot.( The soldiers who shot Lean Bear were ordered to kill
            Indians , period.). On November 29, 1864,&nbsp; a colonel named
            Chivington attacked the camp of Black Kettle and White Antelope.
            When he saw them, White Antelope rode to meet them. As the bullets
            tore through him, White Antelope sang a death song.

                  to not worry, that with the flags, they would be safe. But the
                  soldiers shot at the camp, scattering everyone. Soldiers
                  killed an estimated 600 horses and mules. Many drunk soldiers
                  cut off body parts as souvenirs. </td>

            from a field. they were heading back to their ranch when Chivington
            fired. The Indians Made a skirmish line, in which all were shot.
            Chiefs met the Little Arkansas river, signing away ownership of
            lands and agreeing to peace. They moved south of the river, where
            they lived like before white man came.

                  General Hancock. By the fall of 1864, Hancock was relieved of
                  command. Grant asked him if he would go to Cold Harbor and
                  fight. Hancock refused. Hancock was interested to meet the Dog
                  soldiers. He and soldiers joining him rode to a camp.&nbsp;
                  The Indians there sent everyone away on ponies. Those who
                  stayed behind were ordered by Hancock to bring them back. they
                  did not return. Hancock burned the village to the ground. Dog
                  soldiers appeared and attacked. When the gallant Roman Nose
                  was killed, Indians lost all hope. They journeyed to join
                  Black Kettle. He&nbsp; accepted them warmly. A while later,
                  Black Kettle was horrified to see Custer and company riding
                  toward the camp, firing their weapons. Black Kettle and his
                  wife, Medicine Woman, mounted a horse and were at the bank of
                  the Washita river when they were shot dead. All the Plains
                  Indians hesitantly accepted reservation.</td>
