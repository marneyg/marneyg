      Among the Cheyenne he was known as &quot;Long Hair.&quot; The Arikara knew
      him as &quot;Creeping Panther Who comes in the Night&quot; and the Crow
      called him &quot;Son of the Morning Star Who Attacks at Dawn.&quot; George
      Armstrong Custer was known as many things throughout his life. He was
      known as a hero, and enemy, an army officer, and a loving husband. The
      best thing he was known for was The Battle of Little Big Horn or
      &quot;Custer's Last Stand&quot;&nbsp;</font></td>

      Custer was born in New Rumley, Ohio on December 5, 1839. He grew up on a
      farm with his parents, Emanuel and Maria. Armstrong had three brothers and
      one sister. He graduated from Alfred Stubbins' Young Men's Academy in
      Monroe, in 1855. Custer then moved back to Ohio to teach at Beach Point
      School in Harrison. In 1856, he petitioned to Ohio Congressman, John
      Bingham, for an appointment to West Point. In 1857, he enrolled in West
      Point. After four years of going to West Point, he graduated at the bottom
      of his class. Two days after graduation, while on duty as
      officer-of-the-guard, he failed to stop a fight between two cadets. Custer
      was court-martialed for this, but was saved punishment because of the
      outbreak of the Civil War and the urgent need for officers.&nbsp;</font></td>

      At age 23, he was the youngest general in the Union Army. Custer did
      unexpectedly well in the Civil War. He reported for duty at Washington.
      General Winfield Scott gave him dispatches to carry to General Irwin
      McDowell, then in command of the Potomac. Custer was assigned to duty as
      Lieutenant of the Fifth Calvary. Many who served with the &quot;Boy
      General&quot; admired him. Many hated him and called him &quot;Glory
      Hunter.&quot; On the day of his arrival at Front Tile, he participated in
      the First Battle of Bull Run. Custer also served, with distinction, in the
      Virginia and Gettysburg campaign.</font></td>

      Although his units suffered enormously high casualty rates
      --even by the standards of the Civil War-- his fearless aggression in
      battle earned him the respect of his Commanding Generals, and increasingly
      put him in the public eye. His Calvary Units played a critical role in
      forcing the retreat of Confederate Robert E. Lee's forces. In gratitude,
      General Philip Sheridan purchased and made a gift of the Appomattox
      surrender table to Custer and his wife, Elizabeth Bacon Custer. (Married
      February 9,1864 at Presbyterian Church in Monroe.) He also received a
      battlefield promotion to General, and personally accepted the White Flag
      of Surrender from General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox.</font></td>

      After the war he was stripped of his battlefield
      commission, and returned to the regular Army as Captain. George Armstrong
      Custer was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel of the Seventh Calvary. This
      began his career as an Indian fighter. In 1867, Custer was court-martialed
      on charges for leaving his command post (to visit his wife), and for
      shooting deserters on the spot and not letting them be treated. He was
      guilty on both charges, and was suspended for a year from the army without
      pay. Ten months later he was later he was reinstated by General Sheridan
      to lead the Campaign against Southern Cheyenne in Oklahoma Territory.</font> </td>

      Custer redeemed himself on November 27, 1868. He raided a Southern
      Cheyenne tribe. (Black Kettle's) This massacre was called the Battle of
      Washita. It took place along the banks of the Washita River. The Cheyenne
      had no warning about this battle. 103 Cheyenne were killed. (Mostly women
      and children) Custer ordered all Cheyenne pets to be slaughtered, (Over
      800 were killed) and all possessions to be burned.</font> </td>

      In 1876 the Army planned to round up the Sioux and Cheyenne Indians onto
      reservations. Custer's regiment joined the expedition, commanded by
      General Alfred H. Terry. Custer's troops were sent west. Advancing much
      more quickly than ordered to, he came upon an Indian village in the valley
      of Little Big Horn River on June 25, 1876. On the verge of what seemed
      like a victory for both the United States and himself, he ordered and
      immediate attack on the village. (He believed that there were only 1,000
      Indians. There was really 2,500-5,000 Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho.) He
      divided his regiment into three columns-- one under Captain Frederick
      Benteen, one under Major Marcus A. Reno, and one under himself. Benteen
      was ordered off to the left to search the mountain valley for Indians.
      Reno was to charge ahead across the river and attack the Indian village.
      Advancing into the bluffs on the right, Custer's column was going to
      attack the village from the rear. His whole column, including himself, was
      killed that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> </td>

      The Battle of Little Big Horn was one of the greatest fiascos the U.S.
      Army have ever encountered. Nobody will ever forget that horrific day when
      Custer was killed. June 25,1876 is one of the most memorable dates in
