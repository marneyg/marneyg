      the battle of Moraviantown. After the victory on Lake Erie led by Perry
      was quickly followed by a battle on land. General Harrison had an army of
      about 7,000 men and all of them were on the shore of Lake Erie. Harrison
      had an infantry<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"> and cavalry of
      about 4,000. Proctor had about 1,000 natives and about 500 soldiers. The
      battle of the Thames was fought near Chatham, Ontario, Canada on October
      5, 1813.</span><span style="font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p>

      September 27, 1813 Harrison wrote a letter to the Secretary of War that he
      would go on the next day but he couldn’t promise that he would overtake
      them. This is when Tecumseh had decided to join the British. He convinced
      Proctor to go into battle. Proctor’s partner Lieutenant Colonel Augustus
      Warburton lost all of his supplies and ammunition to an American raiding
      party. He had planned to trap Harrison and his army on the banks of the
      Thames River, moving the Americans off of the road with his cannons but
      the cannons failed to fire. The American cavalry under Richard Johnson
      charged Proctor’s line; within a few minutes the men had retreated or
      surrendered.</span><span style="font-size:16.0pt;

      was the only chief that could inspire them to continue fighting in the
      conditions that they were fighting in. He could hear the Americans coming
      because of the bugles. The British troops retreated because they were
      tired, sick, and hadn’t eaten properly in two days, so they were very
      weak. The Indians didn’t even realize that the British army abandoned
      them.</span></td>

      Indians had started fighting the British line had already been broken.
      Tecumseh and his warriors were very outnumbered. After the British had
      retreated the Indians tried to slow down the Americans so they destroyed
      the upper part of the bridge at McGregor’s Creek and then they hid in
      the trees on the north side of the stream. The warriors killed 25 of
      Johnson’s men. Tecumseh and his warriors and Johnson and his men went
      onto hand-to-hand combat. Tecumseh and his warrior’s had stayed and
      fought until Tecumseh was killed in the second charge.</span><span style="font-size:16.0pt;
