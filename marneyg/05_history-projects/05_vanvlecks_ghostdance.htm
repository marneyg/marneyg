      and had a vision that sparked the beginning of the Ghost Dance. In this
      vision, Wovoka was taken to the spirit world and given further instruction
      there. The dance began immediately. Within months it spread and evolved
      through out other tribes. The Earth Lodge and Big Head religions were

      written text. All teaching and presentations were transmitted orally only.
      Followers of the religion believed in frequent meditation, ceremonial
      cleansing, prayer and most importantly dancing. The dance itself was
      unique. Other Indian dances were fast paced and had loud drumming, while
      the Ghost Dance was more of a slow shuffle with no drums. The dance
      movements followed the course of the sun. The dance was also unique
      because both men and women participated. In other dances men were the
      primary dancers, singers, and musicians. The dances was preformed for four
      to five days at a time in some tribes. The dance was accompanied by
      singing and chanting, but no drumming. Some tribes even made &quot;ghost
      shirts.&quot; Which were special garments that were believed to be
      completely invincible, even by the whites primary weapon source, guns. The
      shirts were decorated with signs of religious significance, stars, suns,
      moons, and eagle feathers. In Big Foot's tribe, which consisted mostly of
      women who had lost there husbands in battle with Custer, Miles, and Crook, danced until they collapsed or passed out. Hoping to insure the
      return of there deceased warriors.</font>&nbsp;</td>

      frightened to U.S. government. They thought the dance was actually a war
      dance. They feared the dance would turn in to rioting. The U.S. tried to
      outlaw the dance, but failed. The government sent out troops to the Lakota
      camps at Pine Ridge and Rosebud, convinced that they were planning to make
      war. In reaction the Lakota made several strategies to avoid contact with
      the troops. The troops isolated the Ghost Dance leaders from their
      followers. Reservation agents feared that Sitting Bulls influence would
      lead to violence. The military was called out the locate and arrest
      leaders that were considered a threat, such as Sitting Bull and Big Foot.
      Sitting Bull was killed along with eight warriors. The official reason
      given was that they had resisted arrest. After Sitting Bull was killed his
      band fled to join Big Foot, who was one of the first to practice with
      Wovoka. The band fled and were eventually killed. Ending the Ghost Dance,
