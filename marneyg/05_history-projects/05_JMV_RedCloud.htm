      Indian chief and home to both a Pulitzer Prize - winning novelists and a
      Base Ball Hall of Fame pitcher, the town of &quot;Red Cloud&quot; got its
      official start in 1871, 49 years before the real Red Cloud was born. At
      the towns second Fourth of July celebration the following year, there was
      an unplanned buffalo stampede through the middle of the festivities. The
      Burlington and Missouri River Railroad arrive in 1881 and by 1882, It
      connected Red Cloud to both Kansas City and Denver. For a nickel fare, a
      horse-drawn street-car line transported people from the depot to the
      downtown district. It operated until 1917 when the track was torn up to
      make way to new brick-paved streets. This town was named after Red Cloud
      the chief. This town has had a few famous people to which they are, Willa Cather
      a Pulitzer Prize - winning Novelist, Native Son Clarence Athur
      &quot;Dazzy&quot; Vance, Red Cloud's baseball team pitcher.</font></td>

      1822 in western Nebraska. In 1841, he killed Bull Bear who was the chief
      of the Koya Oglalas. In 1866, Red Cloud's warriors laid siege to Fort Phil
      Kearny in December: wipeout William Fetterman and his eighty man command.
      In 1868, Red Cloud signed a treaty to end warfare. The United States
      Government agreed to withdraw troops from Lakota lands near Powder River.
      In 1876, Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho forces to destroy General George
      Armstrong Custer and his men at the battle of the Little Big Horn accused
      of supporting the campaign, Red Cloud and others are arrested. In 1889,
      the United States officials persuaded the Sioux to relinquish eleven
      million acres of land to non-Indian settlers. In 1909, Red Cloud dies at
      Pine Ridge Agency.</font></td>

      twelve he learned how to herd horses so he tried it again and again until
      he was really good at it. Another day, He hit a buffalo with an arrow trying
      to kill it. He jumped on his back and tried to shove it in further but the
      buffalo shoved its head to the side and knocked him off. Both the horse
      and Red Cloud flew in the air. His dad said &quot; One day that the
      stampede will run, you will spring to your feet and run for your life.</font></td>

      up by the entrance as if some creature was about to share its retreat. He
      assumed a bear or a man, so he was ready for battle. He had no room in a
      small TP to withdraw a bow so it was knife to knife or if a bear, knife
      to claws. He waited for hours then all of a sudden he sneezed. Without
      warning a man leaped on top of him. The man appeared to be a Ute hunter.
      Both the Ute hunter and Red Cloud stared at each other then smiled as if
      there was a peace treaty between them.</font></td>

      striking the blow. The young leader, Crazy Horse, was to lead the charge.
      The lieutenants were Sword, Hump, and Dull Knife with little Chief of Cheyenne's,
      while the old man acted as councilors. In less than an half an hour, they
      had nearly cut down a hundred men under the captain of Fetterman, which

      Indians were: &quot;Remove the Indians!&quot; &quot;We are told.&quot;,
      said Red Cloud, &quot;That Spotted Tail is to be the beggars chief.&quot;
      The Indians that talked to the white men only want their riches. How can
      an Indian be popular as a rich man? An Indian cannot be rich if he is
      without being an Indian. Red Cloud has listened patiently to the promises
      of the Great Fathers. The bands separated soon after this council. To
      follow the draft of the buffalo, some in the vicinity of Black Hill of
      others in Big Horn region. Small war parties came time from time over
      stray travelers. They received no mercy at their hands. Red Cloud
      acclaimed the right to guard and hold a force all of his territories which
      had been considered to his people by the treaty of 1868. There were bonds
      of white horses thieves and desperados who took advantage of the situation
      to plunder Indians. In a battle, Red Cloud did not participate in person,
      nor in earlier one with crook upon the Little Rosebud. Red Cloud had a son
      in both battles, he was more than councilor than a warrior, but this man
      were constantly on the field. Spotted Tail surrendered and was in close
      touch with reprehensive of the Government.</font></td>
