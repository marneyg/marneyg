      our American history is the only remaining western community established
      by African Americans after the Civil War. The little town of Nicodemus was
      planned by W.R Hill in 1877 and it was ravened<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>by W.H. Smith , both of these men where black. Smith became the
      President of the town Company and Hill became treasurer. Nicodemus is
      named after a legendary figure who came over on a slave ship. The figure
      later purchased his freedom. The two founders opened this town up to
      slaves from the South and to the east. Simon P. Roundtree was the first
      settler of the town in June 18, 1877. Zack T. Fletcher and his wife the
      daughter of Reverend W.H. Smith, Jenny Smith Fletcher arrived in July, and
      was named the secretary of the Town Company. Roundtree, Fletchers, and
      Smith made claims to their property and built temporary homes in dugouts
      along the prairie.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      Benjamin &quot;pap&quot; Singleton was a leader in the &quot;Great
      Exodus&quot; who brought thousands of Africans west from the formal reconstruction
      South. he also became a pioneer of black nationalism. He also launched one
      of the first back-to-Africa movements in the United States. Singleton was
      born in 1809 in Nashville, Tennessee, where he was sold as a slave several
      times, but always escaped. Finally, he fled to Canada , then settled in
      Detroit, Michigan, where he started a boarding house that helped many
      runaway slaves get to there freedom. After the Civil War, Singleton
      returned to Tennessee where he was convinced that his mission was to help
      his people improve their lives. To do this, in the 1860's he organized an
      effort to buy the farm land of Tennessee for the blacks that he helped.
      His plan failed when whites refused to sell at good prices.&nbsp;</font></b></p>

      Unmoved Singleton began to think about Kansas, where he and a partner
      named Columbus Johnson staked out a black Settlement in&nbsp; Cherokee
      County ,which later failed, and a second blockade in Morris County.
      Singleton told everyone about his settlements through posters that
      circulated widely across the South, and he joined up with Johnson to help
      hundreds of Black Tennesseans move to Kansas between 1877 and 1879. As you
      may know those blacks who followed Singleton's journey west became known
      as &quot;Exodusters&quot; and Singleton himself was known as the
      &quot;Father of the Exodus&quot;. The migration that reached a high in
      1879 was not only inspired by the father, but the end of Reconstruction in
      the South and the KKK. By the year of 1879, which is called the year of
      the &quot;Great Exodus&quot;. Some 50,000 African Americans had moved to
      Kansas, Missouri, Indian, and Illinois. While thousands more had been
      turned back by whites controlling the rivers and roads. In 1880, Singleton
      was called to testify at Congressional hearing on the abrming migration of
      Blacks from the South. By 1881, Singleton was moving forward with his
      plan. He wanted to aid his people by organizing a party called the United
      Colored Links in a black section of Topeka, Kansas called &quot;Tennessee
      Town&quot; because so many of the natives of the state live there.
      Singleton wanted to create industries for the blacks like the whites did
      for the whites. <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">His
      plan did not work when he discovered there was not enough capital within
      the black community to achieve his goal. Changing his plan again,
      Singleton founded an organization called the Chief League, in 1883. Chief
      League was to encourage blacks to emigrate to the Island of Cyprus. Very
      few listened , so he formed the Trans-Atlantic society to help black
      people to move back to them own home, Africa, in 1885. By 1887, this plan
      had come up short. After suffering poor health, Singleton retired from his
      self-appointed services, and died in St.Lewis in 1892. His vision of
      society in which African Americans owned the land, directed the industries
      and held the power power to live on. Finding a successful champion in
      Marcus Ganey, who finally realized many of Singleton's dreams.</span></font></b></p>
