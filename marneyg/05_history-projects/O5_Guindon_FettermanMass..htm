      June of 1866 the government organized a peace conference with the Sioux
      and Cheyenne nations at Fort Laramie in Dakota territory, present-day
      Wyoming. Some of the chiefs at the conference were Spotted Tail and the
      Oglala Chief Red Cloud. Red Cloud's warriors had been raiding settlers for
      years on their way to the gold mines in Montana.</b></font>&nbsp; <b><font face="Monotype Corsiva">The

      wanted permission to build three forts along the Bozeman Trail founded by
      John Bozeman in 1862, to protect the settlers on their way to the mines.
      Right before Red Cloud could come up with a response Henry Carrington
      shows up and says that he has soldiers set up along the trail and that the
      forts are under construction. Red Cloud stormed out of the meeting saying
      &quot;I will defend the trail with my life.&quot; Fort Phil Kearney was
      set up in the northern part of the Rocky Mountains. Right in the middle of
      Sioux hunting grounds.</font></b></td>

      Red Cloud and Roman Nose were assembling Cheyenne and Sioux warriors they
      had around 2,000 warriors. On the 6th of December they attacked a wood
      train. Carrington rode to their rescue only to meet the awaiting warriors,
      he rushed back to the fort and told everyone there not to pursue any Indians
      that ran away. On December 21, 1886 the last day of wood-cutting for the
      year. The Indians attacked and Carrington was going to send out Captain
      Powell but Fetterman demanded to lead the rescue. The captains were
      Fetterman and Brown. They rode out with 80 men the number Fetterman
      bragged could wipe out the whole Sioux nation. The decoys appeared and the
      soldiers chased them like they were not supposed to. They led them away
      from the visual aid of the fort.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></td>

      When they topped out on a crest Fetterman and his men saw the Indians and
      they heard the other group of Indians come up from behind them. Fetterman
      and his men were surrounded it was 80 against 2000.&nbsp; The fight was
      on. The soldiers used everything they had knives, bayonets, guns, when
      they ran out of ammo they used their gunstocks.&nbsp; It was useless to
      even try. The Indians slaughtered the soldiers within 20 minutes. Some
      think Fetterman and Brown shot each other in the head to avoid capture and
      slower death by the Indians.&nbsp; But they examined the bodies before
      they buried them, they found out that Fetterman died a different
      way.&nbsp; He had a crosswire cut on his throat.&nbsp; American Horse said
      he dragged Fetterman from his horse, beat him in the head with a war club,
      and then finished him with a knife.</font></b></td>

      So ended William J. Fetterman's boast about how he could destroy the
      entire Sioux nation with 80 men.&nbsp; After the fight was over the
      Indians stayed around for a celebration party. They scalped and mutilated
      the bodies. All of the major body parts were severed off and laid them
      on rocks to rot. They laid the brains on stones to boil in the sun. They
      gouged out their eyes, To make sure they would be helpless in the
      afterlife.&nbsp; After hearing the gunfire and screams Carrington sent out
      a search party led by Captain Tenodor Ten Eyck&nbsp;&nbsp; They went over
      the ridge and saw the remainder of the soldiers and saw the Indians. The
      Indians taunted them to come and fight with them but Captain Tenodor knew
      better. The Indians named the battle &quot;The Battle of the Hundred
      Slain.&quot; But the whites just know it as &quot; The Fetterman
      Massacre.&quot; Carrington was blamed for the massacre and he retired on
      December 15, 1870 four years after the Fetterman Massacre.</font></b></td>
