      pits. &quot;Many Caches&quot; was located around an area of the Grand
      River in the Indian Territory. (now South Dakota) Even as a young boy,

      While being a leader, Sitting Bull drastically increased Souix hunting
      territory. in 1867, Sitting Bull became chief of the entire Souix nation.
      Sitting Bull was also known for being a leader of the Strong Heart Society
      and also The Silent Eaters, a group concerned with tribal welfare. Sitting
      Bull was also a Lakota chief that united tribes for their survival on the
      northern plains. Sitting Bull was a good leader. He was a very skilled
      warrior, a peace maker, very popular in his tribe, had sympathy for his
      poor and needy, he shared food and even gave away horses to his warriors.

      Sitting Bull's warfare was one of the most important times in Indian
      history. He went to his first battle at the age of 14 in a raiding party
      on a Crow village, and had his first experience with the U.S. army in June
      of 1863. During the next year he fought with the U.S. arny at the Battle
      of Killdeer Mountain. During 1865 he led an attack on a newly established
      fort called Fort Rice in North Dakota. Known for his insight and bravery
      during this battle, he later became chief of the Lakota in 1865. In 1874
      Custer confirmed the discovery of gold in a sacred place to many Lakota's
      as the Black Hills, but settlers couldn't enter the Black Hills&nbsp;
      because of the Fort Laramie Treaty. Ignoring this treaty, settlers and prospectors
      invaded Lakota Territory forcing the Lakota to defend their land. During
      Custer's last battle, Custer surrounded Sitting Bull's camp with the 7th
      Calvary and le a straight attack on the camp. After retreating to a hill,
      Custer was killed along with 3/4 of his regiment. In 1885 Sitting Bull
      left the reservation and began working for Buffalo Bill Wild West show
      earning $50 a week. After leaving Buffalo Bill's, Sitting Bull went back
      close to where he was born and started living the way he used to, but sent
      his children to a Christian school thinking that they would need to read
      and write. In 1877 Sitting Bull left along with his followers into Canada.
      On May 10, 1883, Sitting Bull rejoined the rest of his tribe, but was
      forced to work in a field by an Indian agent. Four years after the battle
      with General Custer at the Little BigHorn, Sitting Bull was forced to
      surrender because he was seeing that it was becoming hard to feed his
      people because of the close to extinction of the buffalo.</b></td>

      Sitting Bull's death was very tragic. He was informed that the Ghost Dance
      would be occurring soon. Authorities feared that Sitting Bull, still known
      as a spiritual leader, would join the Ghost Dance. Then when Lakota police
      broke up the ritual, a gunfight occurred, during this gunfight Sitting
      Bull was shot in the head, killing him.&nbsp; Sitting Bull was buried at
      Fort Yates in North Dakota.</b></td>
