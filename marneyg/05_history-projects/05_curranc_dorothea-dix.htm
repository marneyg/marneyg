      </span>Dorothea Lynde Dix was born on April 4, 1802 in the town of
      Hampden, Maine. She was the oldest child of three born to Joseph Dix and
      Mary Bigelow Dix. Her father was an itinerant Methodist preacher. Her
      family life can be described as abusive and nonexistent. Her mother was
      not in good mental health and her father was an abusive alcoholic. Once
      the family was in Worcester they had two more children, Joseph and
      Charles. Almost immediately Dorothea began to care for her smaller
      brothers. Later in life she commented, “I never knew childhood”. This
      was mainly because of her parents’ unstable household, and her role of
      taking over the raising of her brothers. Many times when the fighting in
      her household got out of control she would take refuge at her
      grandmother’s house, from her father’s side, in Boston.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:navy"><font color="#0000FF"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Even though her household wasn’t the best she learned many things
      from her father that would influence many of her choices in life. When she
      was young he taught her how to read and write, thus when she entered
      school she was way ahead of everyone else. This developed a passion for
      reading and teaching, as she taught her brothers how to read as well. Soon
      after their move to Vermont her parents moved to Worcester, Massachusetts.
      At this time her mother was suffering from acute, incurable headaches and
      her father was drinking heavily. It was decided that at this time that her
      parents were no longer capable of caring for their three children. Madame
      Dix, Dorothea’s grandmother, decided to take the three children to live
      at the Dix Mansion in Boston. Madame Dix sent her son and his wife off to
      live with relatives. At this time, Dorothea was twelve and had already
      been accustomed to caring for her brothers, which is something that
      continued as she lived with her seventy-year old grandmother. <o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:navy"><font color="#0000FF"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Life at the Dix Mansion was extremely different than Dorothea was
      accustomed to. Her grandmother was wealthy and demanded that Dorothea act
      and has interests of a wealthy girl. Her grandmother hired a dance
      instructor and a seamstress to cater to Dorothea’s personal needs.
      However, Dorothea did not want any of these things. At one point her
      grandmother punished her severely for trying to give food and her new
      clothes to the beggar children who were standing at the front gate. At the
      age of fourteen, Madame Dix requested that her sister, who lived in
      Worcester, take care of Dorothea for a “while” and turn into a
      “lady.” Mrs. Duncan, Madame Dix’s sister, agreed to this since she
      was always very fond of Dorothea. Once she arrived at her great aunt’s
      house Dorothea immediately took on the role of a “young lady” so she
      could return to her brothers. However, she was to stay with her aunt for
      nearly four years.<b><o:p>

      1821, she was again residing with her grandmother in Boston. There she
      opened a private school, which was opened to young girls. She ran a free
      evening school for poor children, one of the first in the nation. She
      wrote a number of books for children and parents. Her best known book, <i>Conversations
      on Common Things</i>, published in 1824 and much reprinted, was designed
      to help parents answer kid’s questions such as: “ Why do we call this
      day Monday? What is tin? Why do we call this month January? Does cinnamon
      grow on trees?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
      answers given demonstrated Dix’s extensive knowledge of the natural
      world. She also published <i>American Moral Tales for Young Persons</i>,
      1829, and<i> Meditations for Private Hours</i>, 1828.<o:p>

      </span>She received little formal education, and her appetite for
      knowledge was insatiable. She attended public lectures, read widely, and
      made a point of keeping company with knowledgeable people. She studied
      literature, history, and the natural sciences with a special emphasis on
      botany and astronomy. As a teacher she did her intellectual homework
      before embarking on any project, a practice she continued while she was a
      reformer in her later work. <o:p>

      By the early 1920’s Dix had found her religious home among Unitarians.
      She appreciated the Unitarians emphasis on goodness of God, purity of all
      society. A close friend of William Ellery Channing, the famous pastor of
      the Federal Street Church in Boston, she served time to time as governess
      of the Channing children and sometimes accompanied the family on
      vacations. She felt nearest to God when she was involved in specific
      actions that resulted in measurable good effects.<o:p>

      Anne Heath became a lifelong friend and confidant. Heath like Dix, would
      never marry, but unlike Dix, had grown up in a stable extended family and
      found contentment in domestic activities. They were friends for over 50
      years until Heath’s death in 1878. Dix’s inner world was filled with
      appreciation for poetry, literature, history, and nature, but married by
      loneliness, alienation, and self-deprecation.<o:p>

      teaching career got interrupted time to time by a recurring and severe
      upper respiratory ailment aggravated by a work schedule that afforded too
      little sleep. In 1836 she was forced to take an extended rest. With a
      letter of introduction by Channing Dix moved to Liverpool, England where
      she stayed in the home of a Unitarian philanthropist, William Rathbone.
      They took a great like to Dorothea and treated her with more affection
      than she had ever had with her own family. She remained with them for a
      year, until she gradually gained strength.<o:p>

      In 1837, following the death of her grandmother and her mother, Dix
      returned to the United States. Still not strong enough to resume teaching,
      she supported herself during a period of recuperation and limited travel
      funds from the Dix estate and her savings and royalties from the sale of
      her books.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style="color:navy"><font color="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In March 1841 Dorothea entered the East Cambridge Jail. She had
      volunteered to teach women inmate’s Sunday school class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>When she entered the jail she witnessed such horrible things that
      her life was changed forever. Within the walls of this jail she saw
      prostitutes, drunks, criminals, retarded individuals, and the mentally ill
      all housed together in unheated, unfurnished, and foul-smelling quarters.
      When she asked why the jails were in these conditions their answer was “
      the insane do not feel heat or cold.” <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style="color:navy"><font color="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      She took the matter to court and finally won. Dorothea then proceeded to
      visit jails and almshouses, where the mentally ill were housed, in other
      parts of Boston. Soon her investigations extended over the entire state of
      Massachusetts. She made careful and extended notes as she visited with
      jailors, caretakers, and townspeople. She put all this information
      together, organized it, and took it to the Massachusetts legislature. Her
      timed presentation of her findings completely won over the legislative
      board because her conviction was so powerful. After a heated debate over
      the topic the material won legislative support and the funds were set
      aside for the expansion of Worcester State Hospital. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style="color:navy"><font color="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Dorothea’s views about the treatment of the mentally ill were radical at
      the time. The belief back then was that the insane would never be cured,
      and living within their dreadful conditions of the inmates, showed people
      that mental illness wasn’t all incurable. She stated that, “ some may
      say these things cannot be remedied, these furious maniacs are not to be
      raised from these base conditions. I know they are …I could give many
      examples. One such is a young woman who was for years ‘a raging
      maniac’ chained in a cage and whipped to control her acts and words. She
      was helped by a husband and wife who agreed to take care of her in their
      home, and slowly she recovered her senses.”<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style="color:navy"><font color="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp; Later
      she started to travel to other states and proceeded to do the same
      process: extensive travel to jails and almshouses in a state, careful
      descriptions of conditions in jails and almshouses, and preparation of a
      document comparable to the one which proved successful in Massachusetts.
      Although her health was poor, she managed to cover every state on the east
      side of the Mississippi River. In all she played a major role in founding
      32 mental hospitals, 15 schools for the feeble minded, a school for the
      blind, and numerous training facilities for nurses. She also was
      instrumental in setting up libraries in prisons, mental hospitals, and
      other institutions.<o:p>

      decided to go after her dream in 1848. She sent a letter to the US
      congress asking for 5 million acres of land to be set aside, and to be
      used for care of the mentally ill. In 1854 the bill passed and was
      approved by both houses, but was vetoed by President Franklin Pierce.
      After fighting, Dorothea was really worn out by trying to fulfill her
      dream. She decided to travel to Europe to rest from her thirteen years of

      working to improve treatment of mentally ill patients, and for better
      prison conditions. A week after the attack on Fort Sumter, age 59, Dix
