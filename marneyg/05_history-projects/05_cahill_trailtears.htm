      Americans on this continent, but ninety percent of it was either wiped out
      by disease, famine, or warfare.&nbsp; This only took about three-hundred
      years and people moving to this continent.&nbsp; By the year of 1840 all
      Eastern tribes had been moved west of the Mississippi River.&nbsp; There
      was pressure from citizens on the government to remove all Indians far
      west.&nbsp; One main reason for this was that the Indian tribes were
      uncivilized and therefore unworthy of maintaining their hold on land
      desired by white Christian farmers.&nbsp; Five tribes of the Southeast
      that were known as the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; were:&nbsp; the
      Choctaw, the Chickasaw, the Seminole, the Creek, and the Cherokees.&nbsp;
      The Cherokee Indians were known as the &quot;Treaty Party&quot; because
      they began negotiating a treaty with the government.&nbsp; The government
      made a treaty called The New Echota Treaty signed in 1835.&nbsp; The
      Cherokee Indians signed the treaty which said that the Indians give the
      government all the land East of the Mississippi River and they would get
      five million dollars in return.&nbsp; Also the Cherokee agreed to move
      west of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory, present day
      Oklahoma.&nbsp;</font></b></td>

      the beginning.&nbsp; In 1838 President Martin Van Buren ordered the
      implementation of the Treaty of New Echota.&nbsp; Now the U.S. Army under
      command of General Winfield Scott began rounding up the Cherokees and
      moving them into stockades in North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and
      Tennessee.&nbsp; All in all a total of thirty one forts were constructed for this
      purpose.&nbsp; There were thirteen in Georgia, five in North Carolina, ten
      in
      Tennessee, and one in Alabama.&nbsp; In a report for July 1838 seven camps
      in&nbsp; and around Charleston Tennessee, contained more than
      four-thousand eight hundred Cherokees.&nbsp; At one fort, Gunstocker Spring, there were almost
      two-thousand Cherokees being held.&nbsp; The reason they were placed in camps was so
      that none of the Indians would escape.&nbsp; From these camps they were to
      be moved to Indian Territory.&nbsp; This was to occur in the fall of 1838,
      but did not due to bad weather.&nbsp; The army was now to move thirteen
      thousand Cherokees in the spring of 1839.</b></font></strong></td>

      endured torrential rains, ice storms, disease, and broken
      heartedness.&nbsp; This claimed the lives of at least four thousand men, women,
      and children.&nbsp; One Georgia soldier who took part in the removal
      wrote, &quot;I fought through the War Between the States and have seen
      many men shot, but the Cherokee Removal was the cruelest work I ever
      knew.&quot;&nbsp; Indians were transported by both&nbsp; land and
      river.&nbsp; General Winfield Scott had over 600 wagons, steamers, and
      keel boats.&nbsp; They moved almost sixteen thousand Cherokee by land and
      water.&nbsp; Those who traveled by water left on June 6 by steam boat and
      barge.&nbsp; They made it fine with not many problems.&nbsp; The next two
      groups didn't do so well.&nbsp; They suffered from drought and
      disease.&nbsp; The disease was mainly among the children.&nbsp; The other

      about seven-hundred to one-thousand six hundred&nbsp; Indians each.&nbsp; Those who had signed the Treaty of New

      this group was administrated by U.S. Army Lt. Edward Deas.&nbsp; Most
      detachments had a physician.&nbsp; Some conditions made the journey very
      rough.&nbsp; Road conditions, illness, and distress of winter made death a

      Jackson, though, had been severely wounded at the Battle of Horseshoe

      leading up to this awful event the Indians signed over forty treaties.&nbsp;
      The total mortality rate during the removal and the aftermath was approximately
      eight-thousand.&nbsp; This event was all mainly because of gold, migration, and
      want of land.&nbsp; The Indians were here first, but were killed and
