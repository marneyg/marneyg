      Between 1880 and 1920 around four million Italians came to
      America in search of the &quot;American Dream.&quot; Of all the Italians
      only 10% made a living in agriculture even though back in Italy 75% had
      been peasant farmers. Some Italian Immigrants founded&nbsp; vineyards in
      California and the Finger Lake region of New York, while others worked on
      cotton and sugar plantations in the South. Still the majority of these
      immigrants were unskilled laborers, who worked on construction projects,
      loading and unloading ships in the docks, and on the railroads. The
      Italians developed completely Italian neighborhoods called &quot; Little
      Italy's.&quot; Some well known &quot; Little Italy's&quot; were Boston
      North End and Chicago Near West Side.</font></td>

      Chinese
      immigrants came to America mostly in the time between the California Gold
      Rush in 1849 and 1882, when federal law stopped their immigration. Many of
      these immigrants were men coming to work for short times, sending money
      back home to their families. First Chinese immigrants came to America
      during the Gold Rush in hope for striking it rich. Then they came to
      America trying to start restaurants, laundries, and other small
      businesses, or to work on the railroad. In the 1870's European immigrants
      began to compete for the jobs usually done by Chinese immigrants. With
      hard times beginning, people began to feel hatred and suspicion towards
      the Chinese causing Congress to pass the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882.</font></td>

      In
      1830, 5% of the population in Cincinnati, Ohio were German immigrants. Ten
      years later they were up 30% and a few years later, the German population
      in Cincinnati went from 46,382 to 115,435. In the mid 1800's many came to
      America in search for better jobs and better living conditions than what
      they had in Germany. Many Germans settled in Over-the-Rhine, a district in
      Cincinnati. They were known as hard workers, working in mines and starting
      auto mobile and steel mills in Ohio. The German immigrants were content
      with their new lives shopping in stores ran by German Americans and eating
      in German restaurants.</font></td>

      From 1830 to 1890 many Irish and British fled to America. The
      Irish came trying to flee the potato famine, that killed over a million
      people, and their British landlords. In Ireland it was a time of
      depression and social hardships, with the average age of death 19, in
      rural areas. The British came to America in search of better opportunities.
      They were mostly professionals, independent farmers, or skilled workers.
      While the Irish had little money and little experience in farming, nor any
      interests in it. The age of Irish immigrants coming to America, was teens
      to adults and the British were young but not as young as the Irish.</font></td>

      Ellis Island, in New York City, welcomed over 12 million
      immigrants to the U.S. from 1892 to 1954. Third class passengers were
      ferried over from New York Harbor to the island, where they underwent
      medical and legal examinations. The doctors were famed for their
      ability to identify dangerous diseases in their &quot;six second
      physicals.&quot; Even though the island is known as the &quot;Island of
      Tears&quot;, only 2% of all immigrants were sent away from America because
      of medical reasons or if a legal inspector believes he/she would be a menace
      to society. All inspections were held in the Registry Room also known as
      the Great Hall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      America
      has been shaped by the coming of these immigrants. They have done
      everything they could to have a better life here and in doing so they have
      made America everything she is today. I can almost guarantee that every
      person who reads this website is descended from an immigrant on at least
      one side of the family. What New Yorker could survive without Chinese
      food? Where would men take their dates for romantic dinners if not for the
      Italians? Who would we be if these people had not come to America?</font></p>
