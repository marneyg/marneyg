      started, weapons were very poor. Volunteers were given obsolete weapons as
      both sides tried to arm soldiers. Later, better guns were obtained in
      large amounts and became standard for both sides. A basic infantry weapon
      was the Springfield, made at the Springfield Armory in Massachusetts, were
      called &quot;Springfields&quot; by the soldiers. 1.5 million of the rifles
      were made during the war. The rifle had a 39 inch barrel and could hit a
      target 500 yards away with a .58 caliber bullet.</font></td>

      weapons. The tomahawk was changed with the coming of traders from a stone
      head to a steel head. The Indians also used spears , knifes, and war
      clubs. Among soldiers on both sides, a popular weapon was the Bowie knife.
      Bayonets were attached to gun barrel tips and used in fighting and
      charges. When artillery-men would defend themselves with short-swords
      based on the Roman short-sword.</font></td>

      war consisted mostly of revolvers. There was the Colt Army Model of 1860,
      a streamlined version of the 1848 dragoon. It was the most popular sidearm
      during the war because of it's interchangeable parts. There was the Starr
      Revolver, which had a combustible cartridge, or it could use ball and
      powder. The most interesting was the Le Mat Revolver, a foreign model that
      had two barrels: one fired nine .40 caliber bullets and the other was a
      .63 caliber barrel that had a charge of buckshot.</font></td>

      greatest weapons of the Civil War was the Gatling Gun. Richard Gatling,
      creator of the Gatling Gun, thought that if there was a gun with a high
      rate of fire, it would decrease the amount of soldiers that had to be on
      the field, lessening their chances of contracting diseases. This rapid
      fire gun was used in the U.S. Army for 45 years until it was declared
      obsolete in 1911.</font></td>

      the artillery fought side by side with the infantry. The muzzle loading
      cannons of the time were attended to by 8 man teams who fired, aimed, and
      reloaded the cannons. One artillery unit was called a battery, containing
      6 cannons and over 100 men, led by a captain. A common cannon was the
      12-pound bronze gun. It could fire an explosive shell a mile and canister

      was put 50 to 100 feet to the front and acted like barbed wire, slowing
