      1800's?&nbsp; Forced to work on plantations and obey every word that their
      &quot;master&quot; spoke, slaves had extremely difficult lives.&nbsp; Due
      to the fact that slaves were sold and traded, like property, husbands and
      wives would get separated because one was going to one family while the
      other was going to the another family.&nbsp; Slaves finally found hope
      when the 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865, abolishing slavery
      everywhere throughout the nation.&nbsp; When freed, former slaves found difficulty finding jobs to earn money, due to lack of education they had
      gotten from being enslaved.&nbsp; Luckily, for them, the Freedmen's Bureau
      was established to help aid them and poor white southerners in their time
      of need.</font></b></td>

      He probably faced many of the problems other freed slaves did: finding a
      job, a place to live, and land.&nbsp; Finally, seeing all of the troubles
      freed slaves and white southerners were having, the Freedmen's Bureau was
      organized.&nbsp; It was the first welfare agency organized to give food
      and medical care to these people living in the South.&nbsp; Also known as
      the United States Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, it
      was headed by Major General Oliver O. Howard.&nbsp; Howard had many ideas
      for this agency and it turned out to be one of the most powerful
      instruments of Reconstruction.&nbsp;</font></b></td>

      looked forward to learning after being freed.&nbsp; Unlike the Whites, the
      former slaves weren't able to learn.&nbsp; So, the Bureau, knowing that
      the Blacks &quot;had the natural thirst for knowledge,&quot; as J. W.
      Alvord, an inspector for the Bureau, put it, helped establish nearly 3,000
      school. To do this, the Bureau spent 5 million dollars and by 1865, more
      than 90,000 former slaves were enrolled as students in public schools.&nbsp; Attendance rates at the
      new schools were between 79 and 82%, unlike the White schools that had an
      attendance rate of 43%.&nbsp; So, the schools were overwhelmed by the
      Black's attendances.&nbsp; As Booker T. Washington said, it was &quot;a
      whole race trying to go to school at one time.&quot;&nbsp; One person
      attending a Black school during this time was a 105 year old man, named
      Cupid, who &quot;feared he was almost too old to learn,&quot; but nothing
      stopped Blacks from gaining an education that they had never been able to
      get before.&nbsp; In total, the Bureau spent $400,000 to establish teacher
      training institutions for these schools.&nbsp; The Bureau even helped
      found or aid all major Back colleges at the time.&nbsp; Education for
      Blacks was one of the most successful accomplishments the Freedmen's

      slaves had a craving for.&nbsp; Blacks had trouble getting land because
      they had no money, in which to buy it.&nbsp; These freedmen wanted the
      land, so they could farm it.&nbsp; Congressman Thaddeus Steven suggested
      dividing the South's plantations and giving each freedmen &quot;forty acres
      and a mule,&quot; but that didn't work out.&nbsp; But, Thaddeus still
      argued &quot;We have turned...loose 4 million slaves without a...cent in
      their pockets...This Congress is bound to provide for them until they can
      take care of themselves.&quot;&nbsp; Congress still refused, so the
      Freedmen's Bureau stepped in.&nbsp; Howard, the leader of
      the Bureau, created a trust fund of $52,000, in which to be used by the
      Bureau to purchase land and then resell to Blacks at a more reasonable
      price.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, Bureau agents advised the Blacks to invest their
      own money to lease farms to freedmen and suggested subdividing farms and
      building homes for freedmen, who were willing to work for wages.&nbsp; The
      Bureau did all they could to help the Blacks' land situation.</b></font></td>

      help, but due to lack of organization, they had very little success.&nbsp;
      They found the same unsuccessfulness in their courts when both Blacks and
      Whites complained of violent attacks, mistreatment, and other criminal
      acts. This was because the cases were usually never addressed by local
      authorities.&nbsp; The Bureau had little power in the courts, but they

      dealing with extending its life.&nbsp; Andrew Johnson, the President at
      the time, viewed the legislation allowing the Freedmen's Bureau to arise,
      as an unwarranted and unconstitutional continuation of war powers in this
      &quot;peace time,&quot; after the Civil War.&nbsp; So, Andrew vetoed the
      bill on February 19, 1866, which would have extended its life.&nbsp; But
      fortunately, the bill was passed over Johnson's veto on July 16, 1866, in
      a slightly different form.&nbsp; The next problem it faced was administrators
      lowering its legal agencies, its contract supervision, its medical
      network, and its relief activity.&nbsp; Then by 1869, Congress ended all of
      the Bureau's work except education, which continued in 1870, and help for
      Black veterans, which Congress ended by 1872.&nbsp; So, the Blacks were on
