      <font face="AYTYellowjacket" size="4">Nathan Bedford Forrest was born in
      Bedford County, Tennessee near Chapel Hill. On July13, 1821 he and his
      twin sister were born.&nbsp; Nathan Forrest was born into a poor middle
      class family, so as you can see he had it hard from the beginning.&nbsp;
      At the age of 17his father died and Nathan became the head of the
      household.&nbsp; Forrest only had about 6 months of formal education, but
      that didn't stop him.&nbsp; He was determined to pull his family and
      himself up and out of poverty.&nbsp; So, with no education to speak of,
      Forrest became a cotton planter, slave trader, real estate broker,
      plantation owner, and a businessman.&nbsp; By around the time of the Civil
      War, in 1861, he was a millionaire.&nbsp; In fact he was one of the
      richest men in the south.&nbsp; At this time his fortune was about
      $1,500,000.</font>

      Since Forrest had a
      great deal of money invested in slaves, slave trading, and they where the
      ones working the plantation he supported the Confederates.&nbsp; He
      decided to enlists with no former military training, and knowing nothing
      about military operations along with his brother and his fifteen year old
      son.&nbsp; They enlisted in June of 1861.&nbsp; Forrest started out with
      no intentions of becoming a major factor, he only wanted to support the
      Confederates.&nbsp; Forrest started out as a private in Josh H. White's
      cavalry company on June 14,1861.&nbsp; Forrest was a hard worker and that
      didn't go on unnoticed. He worked his way up and had many assignments.&nbsp;
      Here are a few of his assignments :</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="AYTYellowjacket" size="4">lieutenant colonel, Forrest's
          Tennessee Cavalry (October 1861)</font></li>
        <li><font face="AYTYellowjacket" size="4">commanding cavalry brigade
          Army of Tennessee (November 20, 1862 to the summer of 1863)</font></li>
        <li><font face="AYTYellowjacket" size="4">major general, CSA (December
          4, 1863)</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="AYTYellowjacket" size="4">These are only a few of his assignments,
      there are many more, but as you can see from only these few things that he
      played a very important part in the Civil War.&nbsp;Nathan is famous for
      his Civil War accomplishments as a general.&nbsp; Many consider him the
      most brilliant cavalry men of the Civil War.</font></p>

      After the war was over Forrest had lost his fortune because a lot of his
      money was invested in the slaves and now they were not worth
      anything.&nbsp; Nathan also financed a regiment all on his own, and he
      gave what was left to his men.&nbsp; This was because they had nothing to
      go home to.&nbsp; So Forrest had to start over and he went back to
      planting and became president of Selma, Marion, and Memphis
      Railroads.&nbsp; Nathan Forrest also became the first leader of the Ku
      Klux Klan known as the &quot;Grand Wizard&quot; in 1866.&nbsp; The Klan
      was a group of Confederate veterans&nbsp; who aided confederate orphans
      and widows of the Civil War.&nbsp; Soon after the Klan got started they
      began using force against blacks and other races.&nbsp; These people were
      against reconstruction and were causing many problems.&nbsp; In 1869
      Forrest ordered the Klan to disband and a few groups did but a lot of them
      stayed active and ignored what Forrest had said.&nbsp; Then Nathan quit
      because he did not agree with what was going on and he went back to his
      own business in Memphis.&nbsp;</font></p>

      Forrest served as the
      head of the Ku Klux Klan from 1867 to 1869, and even though he didn't
      agree with what the Klan was doing, his name will always be associated
      with the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan is still active in some places across the
      United States to this day.</font></td>

      Nathan Bedford
      Forrest died from diabetes in Memphis Tennessee on October 29, 1877.&nbsp;
      Forrest had the ability to inspire the people he was leading.&nbsp;
      Nathan's formula for success was &quot;Get in there first with the most
      men.&quot;&nbsp; Even though he made some poor decisions that will
      overshadow his great military career forever, he was still one of the most
      successful generals of the Civil War and has developed tactics that are
      still being studied today.&nbsp; Nathan entered the world a poor man and
      ended up being a millionaire without any formal education.&nbsp; he also
      entered the army a private and left a general with out any former military
      training, so he must have known what he was doing or he was just born to
      lead.</font></td>
