    Bleeding Kansas was the period in history which got the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attention of
    America , Not because it was bloody, but newspaper editorials (east and Kansas Newspapers)
    and politicians speeches. Because in the end only about 55 people died violently in six
    years. Mostly of it was based on politics playing an unnecessary violence in that period
    of time.</font></strong></td>

    who were people against slavery, who settled in Kansas. Another one was the antislavery
    group. the antislavery group was people in America who were against slavery. Finally, the

    A new bill was introduced by Stephen A Douglas stating that Kansas and
    Nebraska&nbsp;&nbsp; were going to be decide by popular sovereignty to see if it was going
    to be a slave state or a free state. The act was called the Kansas and Nebraska act. But

    The leader of the free state Movement Montgomery, was also involved in several violent
    acts. John Brown who was against proslavery, He and his sons at Pottawatomie Creek Killed
    5 proslavery 'advocates. Also Franklin Coleman (a proslavery man) killed Chales W. Dow ( a
    free-stater). A friend of Charles W. Dow who attended a free-stater protest and got
    arrested by the pro-slavery authorities. He was later rescued by sheriff sone. This
    started the Wakarusa War. Something else kind of similar happened when Jones arrested
    several free-staters to get even after he got shot and wounded. He put the free-staters he
    arrested in jail at Lecompton. He did not find some of the free-staters he was looking
    for. Reeder (one of the people he was looking for got out disguised as a wood cutter. Plus
    in an attempt to try to burn down the western hotel on June 1858 a few shots were freed
    into and at the surrounding houses.</font></strong></td>
