      <font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1858, Geronimo and
      his band were camped outside of a town called Janos. For two days they
      drank and traded with the towns people. On the third day General Carrasco
      and his troops struck with a surprise attack. The blow was horrible for the
      Indians. Geronimo and a few other Apaches barley escaped .&nbsp; In this
      battle the Whites took the lives from his Mother, Wife, and three
      children. After this loss, Geronimo and his few friends slipped back across the
      border.</font></td>

      <font size="4">Geronimo now went to different tribes to get as many
      warriors as he could.( After he gets his men he would start a long period
      of raiding .) He wanted revenge for his Families deaths. Geronimo chose to
      start his raids on the town Arizpe in Sonora. A commander and a number of
      troops were in the town.</font></td>

      The first day a Mexican Commander and two companies of infantry marched
      out. Along with them came a pack train full of ammunition and rations. The
      Indians wanted it and just before dusk they struck from the flank and the
      train was in their hands. The next morning they came with everything&nbsp;
      they had. The Indians made a Simi-circle and the troops marched right into
      the ambush. Eventually it came down to Geronimo and another soldier and
      Geronimo killed him. Geronimo later said that ' the Mexicans weren't worth
      counting'.&nbsp;</font></td>

      Geronimo and his tribe were forced onto a reservation in San Carlos (in
      Eastern Arizona ). Geronimo wanted to be free and he soon fled into
      Mexico, raiding along the way with his band of followers. Geronimo was
      soon arrested and returned to the reservation. He stayed on the
      reservation for 5 years until an Apache profit, on the reservation, was
      killed. Geronimo fled to the Sierra Madres once again. In May 1882 Apache
      scouts, working for the U.S. Army, surprised Geronimo in his Mountain hideout. Geronimo then agreed to return to the reservation.</font></td>

      After a year of farming, rumors of Ka-ya-ten-nae being murdered and other Indians
      being hung, Geronimo was tempted to run again. On May 17, 1885,
      with 35 warriors, and 109 women and children, Geronimo fled. But only to
      be caught in January of 1886 by Apache Scouts. Geronimo fled once more but
      surrendered to General Nelson Miles on September 4, 1886. In the end his
      group consisted of 16 warriors, 12 women, and 6 children.</font></td>

      After Geronimo's last surrender, the Government transported him, and
      nearly 450 Apache men, women, and children, to Florida for confinement in
      Forts Marion and Pickens. The last few months of Geronimo's freedom
      required 5,000 soldiers( or one quarter of the entire army), 500 scouts,
      and up to 3000 Mexican soldiers to track home down.</font></td>

      On February 17, 1909, as a prisoner of war, Geronimo died of pneumonia. He
      wanted to be return to his homeland to be buried but wasn't allowed. So he
      was buried in the Apache Cemetery at Fort Sills, Oklahoma.&nbsp; </font></td>
