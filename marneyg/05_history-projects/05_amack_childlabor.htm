      <p><b><font size="3" face="AYTPesky">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rise of child
      labor in the United
      States began in the late 1700s and early 1800s. When the Industrial Revolution
      started, many families had to find someone to work or they wouldn't
      survive. When European immigrants came they weren't strangers to hard work. When they came they
      brought opinions or values that said that children should work. That's when children
      really started working. Many families moved from rural areas to cities
      newly industrialized. When it all started it went widespread and no one
      became concerned when the children didn't even get a modest education. By
      1900, 2 million children were working so that their families could survive.&nbsp;</font></b></p>

      Immigration only made
      the child labor problem worse.
      In the late 1800s there were 1,600 laws for child labor in the United
      States all together. These laws regulated working conditions and limited
      or forbidded child labor. These laws did not apply to any immigrant
      because they were thought not as American citizens but as low, poor
      people who didn't belong.</b></font></p>

      day. Most kids don't even go to school for 7 hours. An average day of work
      for adults is around 10 hours. These little children work 6 days a
      week, all year long. Kids today only go to school for 5 days. Then the
      extremely low wages were only a fraction of what adults got, if they got
      pay at all. They even tried to justify giving orphans nothing by saying
      that they provided clothing, shelter, and food. These &quot;necessities&quot;
      were never given to the orphans. All the time children were exhausted and

      machines they were made textile assistants. These workers often abuse the
      children verbally and physically. When the children were late they had to
      walk up and down aisles in the factory for and hour with a heavy weight
      hanging on their neck. This punishment was said to make others &quot;take
      example&quot;. They would usually end up with serious injuries to the neck
      and back. Sometimes boys were dragged out of bed and sent to work naked
      with their clothes to be put on at work so that they wouldn't be even a
      minute late. Since little children can't keep up with this pace they were
      constantly hit with straps and dipped head first into a cistern of water
      head first, so they wouldn't be drowsy on the job. Even orphans who were potential
      runaways were made to wear irons so they couldn't run. These tortures were
      very cruel and unusual bur most people know nothing about how their safety
      was neglected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></td>

      just one year. And their employers would not even care even a little. Many

      shelter. One man, Lewis Wickes Hines, quit teaching to go and take pictures
      of children working and expose the horrors of child labor to naive people.
