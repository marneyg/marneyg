 Little Bighorn National Monument near
      Crow Agency Montana, commemorates one of America's most famous battles.
      The battle of the Little Big Horn. on June 25and26, 1876, two cultures clashed
      in a life or death battle.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1875 Sioux and Cheyenne Indians
      left their reservations outraged by the continued intrusions of whites
      onto their sacred lands in the black hills. They gathered in Montana with
      Sitting Bull to fight for their lands. In 1876 the united states
      government launched a military campaign upon a portion of the Sioux and
      Cheyenne Indians who refused to live within the boundaries of the great Sioux
      reservation.&nbsp;</font></td>

      found a nearby group of 40 warriors, ignoring orders to wait he attacked

      warriors in the village numbered three times his strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      the group across the river, and charge the Indian village with the
      remaining troops under his command. Reno's soldiers quickly found
      themselves in a battle with little hope of relief. Reno halted his
      charging men before they could be trapped. He fought for ten minutes in
      dismounted formation then withdrew into the timber and brush along the
      river. When that position proved to be indefensible they retreated up a
      hill into the bluffs east of the river, pursued by a mix of Cheyenne and
      Sioux warriors.&nbsp;</font></td>

      drove Custer's men in confusion. Many of them threw down their guns and
      raised their hands in the air saying, &quot; Pity us Sioux take us prisoners
      &quot; the Sioux killed all of them.&nbsp;The Indians chased Custer's men
      across the Little Bighorn. The banks of the river were high and the Sioux
      killed allot of the men there while crossing.&nbsp;</font> </td>
