      Two of the Southern Cheyenne chiefs, Black Kettle and White Antelope met
      with Colorado's Governor John Evans, Colonel Chivington, and&nbsp; even
      President Abraham Lincoln, so that their camp and people would be safe and
      not be attacked by the army, or anyone else. President Lincoln gave Black
      Kettle an American flag and a white peace flag, so that the soldiers would
      know not to attack them. He also gave White Antelope&nbsp; a peace
      medal.&nbsp; And even though they got peace, it didn't last. On the day of
      their peace meeting with Governor John Evans, Chivington received a
      telegram from Samuel Curtis saying &quot;I want no peace till the Indians
      suffer more. No peace must be made without my directions. Black Kettle was
      told that he could camp on Sand Creek, which is in the Colorado territory, under the promised protection of Fort
      Lyon, so he went back south to Sand Creek, while the others, who opposed
      the peace agreement joined the Sioux up North.</font></td>

      at dawn on November 29,1864, Chivington and his men (volunteers and
      regular troops, from Fort Lyon) were told to take no prisoners and descended
      onto the Sand Creek camp. Black Kettle believed that there was no danger
      when he saw the soldiers galloping towards him and his camp, so he calmly
      raised his American flag and his white peace flag, both from President
      Abraham Lincoln, to reassure his people. White Antelope could tell that
      they meant harm and yelled, &quot;Stop! Stop!&quot; in English so they
      could understand him, but they didn't stop. So he folded his arms and sang
      his death song, &quot;Nothing live long, except the earth and the
      mountains&quot;, he refused to fight. And then, as a response, the
      troops&nbsp; began shooting at them. Most of the Indians fled to the sandy
      banks of the dry creek and frantically began digging pits for protection.
      the warriors, that had been capable of grabbing their weapons fought back
      in a desperate defense, they killed only 8 and wounded only 38 of the
      attackers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      The Indians were killed no matter what they were did; flee, surrender,
      plead for mercy, fight back, or even stand there and do nothing. Groups of
      women were shot trying to surrender, children were shot and/or clubbed to
      death, some women were pleading for mercy. Over 150 Indians were killed,
      men and mostly&nbsp; women, children. including White Antelope, by the
      soldiers. Most of the bodies were mutilated, and part of White Antelope
      was cut off and used as a tobacco pouch, according to Congressional
      testimony. Black Kettle's wife miraculously survived the attack, she was
      shot 9 times. The men finally ended their attack and killed all the
      Indians they found wounded that were not quite dead yet. They also scalped
      and mutilated the dead men, women, children, even pregnant women and
      babies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      the Joint Committee investigated the attack. they decided to charge
