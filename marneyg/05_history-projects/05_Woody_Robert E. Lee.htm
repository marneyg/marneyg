      States elected President Abraham Lincoln. When this happened the south seceded
      form the United States as the Confederate States of America. In doing so
      the president called on Robert E. Lee to take down the Rebels and to
      return them to the United States but doing so he would have to face his
      own family in the south as well as brothers he could not do that he told
      the president. So he then went down south to Virginia to offer his
      services to Jefferson Davis president of the C.S.A (Confederate States of
      America). Davis accepted and then he was stated into the North Virginia Army
      as a General.&nbsp;</font></p>

      out the Civil war&nbsp; Robert and the rest of his Generals won stunning
      victories over the north some of which were deemed impossible to win for
      the south. A famous battle was the battle of Atiedem a battle in which the
      south was losing but when &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson arose and stood
      through the battle able to get shot the men all chanted &quot;hey look
      it's Stonewall Jackson sitting there like a brick wall&quot; this in turn
      rose their Morale and they took the North by storm. Later they one the
      Battle and came home to the south with yet another victory. But soon
      Lincoln was tired of Generals he hired to just keep on losing so then he
      came across a promising General named Ulysses S. Grant. Grant went into
      battles and won with astounding victories over the south, which were very
      needed now because the British and the French were willing to help the
      south to end the war. But by now it was far to late for any other country
      to come into the war now, Grant had Lee on the run and eventually led Lee
      to surrender at the Appomattox Court House on April 9th, 1865. Robert E.
      Lee Died October 12, 1870 of Heart Disease.</font></td>
