      Horse was born along Rapid City, South Dakota to the east of the Pacho
      Sapa, Black Hills. He was born in 1842. He was killed in 1877.&nbsp; He
      was born into two tribes. The Oglala and the Brule-Sioux.&nbsp; He was the
      son of an Oglala medicine man by the same name, and his Brule wife the
      sister of Spotted
      Tail.&nbsp; His mother died when he was young, and his father took her
      sister as his wife, the sister of of spotted tail to help raise Crazy
      Horse.&nbsp; When he was a child, people called him curly. Before he was
      12, he had killed a buffalo and received&nbsp; his own horse.&nbsp; At the
      age of sixteen, he held his fathers name Crazy horse.</font><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4">When
      the Brule leader was killed, Crazy Horse underwent a vision quest.&nbsp;
      In this quest he had a meaningful dream of a rider in a storm on
      horseback, with long unbraided hair, a small stone in his ear, zigzag
      lighting decorations on his cheek, and hail dotting on his body.&nbsp; He
      was a very mighty warrior although he never scalped anyone. The storm
      continued and a red-backed hawk flew over the rider's head. When he told
      his father , his father saw it as a sign of greatness in battle, after the
      vision his father renamed him Crazy Horse.&nbsp; When he was 16 he rode
      into his first battle just like in the dream, with long unbraided hair and
      an earring he rode fearlessly as Crazy Horse the Warrior&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

      <font size="4">After getting wounded at his first battle trying to scalp
      someone, he never scalped anyone again.&nbsp; He became known throughout
      the Sioux for his courage in the Bozeman trails of 1866-68 under the
      Oglala, Red Cloud, when the army began building a road in powder river
      country from the Oregon trail.&nbsp; He was one of the youngest chiefs,
      along with Hump.&nbsp; He was one of the youngest chiefs the Sioux or the
      Oglala had ever had, he was also one of the greatest.&nbsp; He was never
      selfish; he always did what was best for the Tribe. He was a real chief.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

      the middle of the camp.&nbsp; Custer and all his men were killed.&nbsp;
      The Indian women&nbsp; stabbed his ears so he could hear his promises. He
      promised he would never wage war on the Sioux.&nbsp; Crazy Horse was
      captured and taken to Fort Robinson.&nbsp; They were taking him to a cell
      when he realized what was going on.&nbsp; He tried to bolt out of the jail
      house, when on of his own tribe held him while he got stabbed and
