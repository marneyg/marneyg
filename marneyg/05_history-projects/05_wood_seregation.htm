      unjust separation of people based on their&nbsp; gender ,race, religion, or
      class. This website will be based on the segregation of races. segregation
      was at its peak of existence during the 1800's through the
      1900's.segregation was everywhere possible such as in places like schools,
      institutions for the blind, deaf, metal institutions, cemeteries, prisons,
      military units, boats, trains, hotels, waiting rooms, restaurants, elevators,
      hospitals, public bathrooms, pools, water fountains, churches, and a lot
      of other places. white people thought this kind of segregation was a good thing.
      They liked it better by being totally excluded from the blacks. Around the
      year 1887 the democratic party regained power the party put an end to
      reconstruction. Which made matters worse for the blacks. the government
      had ways to keep the blacks from voting by using poll taxes and Fees that
      were to high and literacy tests to see if they could read. By 1883 the
      Supreme court&nbsp; stated that the congress couldn't prevent private acts
      of discrimination ''.Basically cases such as Plessy vs. Ferguson proved
      that they could stop blacks from voting and segregation could be done".segragation
      usually&nbsp; came hand in hand with violence. mostly because the police
      and most legal systems were in favor of segregation. Some organizations
      were very violent such as the Ku Klux Klan or otherwise known as the
      KKK.The KKK&nbsp; dressed in white and performed acts of terrorism. They
      murdered more than a thousand or more black people. They also burned them
      alive, shot them, and mobbed them. Black codes- for 200 years the black
      codes limited rights of blacks. but in &quot;1868 they abandoned laws that
      discriminated&nbsp; against blacks&quot;.</font></b></td>
