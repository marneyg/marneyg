      Nashville Tennessee, Singleton was born a former Davidson slave. Paps real
      name is Benjamin Singleton but most people call him Pap. Pap was raised
      and trained to be a cabinet maker. After Singleton&nbsp; was sold and sent
      to New Orleans he escaped back to Nashville then to Detroit then returned
      to Nashville which was under the Union Army. Pap lived in a large Union
      camp for fugitive slaves along the riverbank in Edgeville.. While at
      Edgeville Singleton made cabinets and coffins for a living. Pap decided to
      try and make an escape for Canada three times but failed all three. So
      after that he mad his way to the Under Ground Rail Road and from there
      to&nbsp; Ontaria.. After
      the Under Ground Rail Road&nbsp; Pap returned to Detroit where he worked
      until 1865 as a boarding-house for fugitive slaves.</font></b> </td>

      migrating from the south. Since the meeting failed to gain vote for the
      Exodus, Pap and a black preacher from Summer County named Columbus M.
      Johnson organized a&nbsp; Homestead Assoiation. In 1872 the Assotiation
      sent a committe to look at Kansas to consider settlement. One year later
      Johnson, Singleton and 300 boarded steamboats set off on the cumberland
      river to parts of Kansas such as Cherokee County, Wyandotte and Topeka.
      For years afterwards the north part of Topeka was know as &quot;Tennessee
      Town&quot;. Singletons goal was to get blacks to start there lives and
      make factories in Topeka but the Capital City wasnt big enough.</font></b></td>
