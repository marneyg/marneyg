      The Black Hills gold rush originally began in late July 1874 when the 7th Calvary
      searched the Black Hills area for a location to establish an army post.
      The gold was found on some land that was set aside for Indians. Some
      miners were still sneaking in even after they were told to stay out of the
      Indian territory. Military forces tried to hold back the tide of
      gold-fevered prospectors, escorting them out of the Sioux treaty lands,
      but it was like emptying a wash tub with a teaspoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></font></td>

      By the Fall of 1875 there were an estimated 500 miners in the Black Hills.
      The gold rush started a conflict between the United States and the Great
      Sioux Nation. In late August 1875, prospectors from Montana had located
      deposits of gold of gold paying twenty to forty cents to the pan.</b></font></td>

      On June 15, 1876 the Battle of the Little Bighorn between the 7th Calvary
      and the Lakota Nation with their allies Cheyenne and Arapahos at Greasy
      Gras, Montana took place. Sitting Bull and his 4,000 warriors were
      encamped when Custer and his troops came upon them. Hopelessly outnumbered
      200 of Custer's troops were killed in less than twenty
      minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></td>

      By July of 1876, a million dollars of gold at $20 an ounce had been taken
      from the Black Hills. By this time approximately 10,000 people populated
      the Hills. During the summer of 1876 $500,000in gold was shipped out of
      the gulch in massive iron safes in the treasure coaches. Armored coaches
      were put on the line in 1878, often transporting as much as $200,000 in a
      single shipment. An 1877 shipment worth $350,000 weighed in at more than
      1,000 pounds. More than 7,000 miners arrived and left the Black Hills
      during the year of 1876 when the total gold production amounted to about
      $1,500,000.</b></font></td>

      miners didn't really care that they were taking gold from the land that

      to solve the problem of ownership of the Hills by inviting American Indian

      From 1876 to 1890 when the railroad was being built in Deadwood, gold was
      shipped out of the Hills on stage coaches, attractive targets for road
      agents. From the earliest diggings near Custer, the gold seekers migrated
      north to Hill City and Palmer` Gulch, Harney, Hayward, and Keystone,
      Rockerville and on to Deadwood gulch. The railroad seemed to be the
      fastest and best rout to the gold mines in the Black Hills. There was a
      lot of gold taken from the Black Hills during these years.</b></font></td>
