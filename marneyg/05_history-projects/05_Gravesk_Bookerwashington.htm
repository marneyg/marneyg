      1865 on James Burroughs Tobacco farm. His mother was a cook for him, and
      his dad was a white man from a nearby farm. He went to school in Franklin
      County- not to learn , but to carry books for one of James' daughters
      because it was illegal to educate slaves. &quot;My master and his sons all
      worked together side by side with his slaves.&quot; Washington explained
      in his Autobiography, Up From Slavery, &quot; In this way we all grew up
      together... there was no overseer, and we got to know our master and he to
      know us.&quot;</font></td>

      acres, and he owned only 10 slaves. In April, 1865 The Emancipation Proclamation
      was read in front of the Burrough's house. Bookers family left and went
      to join his stepfather in Malden, West Virginia. He took a job at a salt
      mine that began at 4 a.m. so he could attend school later in the day.</font></td>

      <p align="left"><font face="AYTSundown">A few years later, Booker was
      taken in as a house boy by a wealthy towns woman who further encouraged
      his longing to learn. When he was 16 he walked almost 500 miles back to
      Malden to enroll in a new school for black students. This school was
      called Hampton Agricultural Institute and graduated. After that he found a
      job at another school there and became and instructor, and was employed by
      Samuel Armstrong to teach Native Americans. In 1880 William Foster and Arthur
      Brooks won a local election and then used there influence to secure
      approval for building a negro school called Tuskegee Institute. Samuel
      Armstrong, principal of Hampton Institute, was asked to recommend a white
      teacher to take charge of the school, but Samuel suggested that it would
      be better to employ Washington instead.</font></td>

      opened on the 4th of July in 1888. The school received funding of $2,000 a
      year, that was only enough to pay the teachers. The school taught
      subjects, but emphasized a practical education. This included Farming,
      Carpentry, Brick making, Shoemaking, Printing, and Cabinetmaking. Students
      worked long hours, waking up at 5 a.m. and finishing at 9:30 at night. The
      school owned 540 acres of land and had over 400 students. And later,
      Southern whites who were against Washington educating the blacks, started
      to support is ideas and got for it.</font></td>
