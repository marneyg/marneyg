      Arapaho, Arikara, Asbinboine, Cheyenne, Crow, Gras, Ventre, Blackfoot
      tribes and many more. Early on the third or fourth day the true worship of

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The buffalo made up the main parts of the

      accompanied&nbsp; the Sundance. These people's lives inter-wind with the
      buffalo. This relation was praised and blessed with the Sundance. The
