      Indians they were food, clothing, tools, and vtensels. Most of all the
      buffalo was a spirit&nbsp; that blessed them them with everything they
      need to survive. A major part of the Indian life centered around the
      buffalo herds. They moved them during all but the winter months.&nbsp;</font></font></td>

      a Childs name included the word buffalo in it the Indians believed that
      the child would be especially strong and mature quickly. Buffalo calling
      was a constant and essential practice on the plains. Buffalo often licked themselves
      and in the process swallowed some of their hair. over the years the hair sometimes
      formed itself into a perfectly&nbsp; round ball two inches or more in diameter
      or more. such a ball was a great find&nbsp; and it immediately became a
      buffalo calling item for ritual use.&nbsp;</font>

      would present a bowl of food to a mounted buffalo head in belief that it
      would send out messages to living&nbsp; animals telling them of the Indian generosity.
      it told them to come closer. the Indians prayed constantly to the great spirit
      to send them meat. sometimes they pleaded with the herds close behind. the
      holy men of the Sioux enticed the herds, the herds, and the carcass of the
      first animal slain and a large hunt was always&nbsp; sacrificed to
