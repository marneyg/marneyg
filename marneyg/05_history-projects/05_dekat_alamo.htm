      Lets
      start back at 1710 when the viceroy of new Spain, the Margue's de Valero,
      Authorizes the&nbsp; relocation of the mission of San Francisco Solano
      from the Rio Grande to the San Antonio river.&nbsp; In 1719 the mission is
      now moved to the east side of the river.&nbsp; Then in 1720 a second mission,&nbsp;
      San José' Miguel de Aquay was established on the river south of&nbsp; San
      Antonio De Valero following that is 1724 when a heavy rain wash San
      Antonio De Valero (the Alamo) were it is now! Then in 1744, the first cornerstone
      is laid for a church at San Antonio De Valero&nbsp; the church took
      four&nbsp; years to finish. Soon after the King of&nbsp; Spain ordered
      for&nbsp; San Antonio De Valero's land to be given evenly to all of the
      settlers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></em></i></td>

      Now lets go to 1803 when&nbsp; San Antonio De Valero is used for military
      post for the second company of San Carlos De Parras from vicinity of the
      town of El&nbsp; Alamo in Coachella.&nbsp; Then in 1806 part of the
      mission is now used as a Military Hospital.&nbsp; But in 1807,&nbsp;
      Zebulon Pike was arrested by the Spanish authorities near headwaters of
      the Rio Grande is cordially received in San Antonio&nbsp; by the
      governor,&nbsp; Pike later reports that the town is laid out on a grand
      plan and notes the station of the troops &quot;the Alamo-east of the
      water.&nbsp; Then in 1817, Francisco Xavier Mina&nbsp; launches a military
      expedition against the Mexican from Galveston Island.&nbsp; Oh and in
      1813, after years of fighting over the fort called the Alamo, an Antonio
      is left in a economically devasted area.&nbsp; Now in 1821 the plan of
      Iguala assures Mexicans independence,&nbsp; But&nbsp; in July, San Antonio
      officials swear allegiance to the new independent&nbsp; nation of
      Mexico.&nbsp; Now in 1821 carrying out his fathers plan Stephen F. Austin
      brings his first colonists to Texas , Afterwards in 1824 under the new
      constitutional&nbsp; government Coequally&nbsp; Texas becomes a
      state&nbsp; with the capitol Saltillo. Then in 1833 a second&nbsp;
      convention at San Antonio, While there Austin proposes more change
      .Afterwards in 1836&nbsp; on Feb 3 William Barret Travis and a small group
      of reinforcements arrive at the Alamo under the command of James C.Neil.</font></em></i></td>

      Ok
      now that the timeline is done why don't I tell you about&nbsp; just the
      Alamo.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mission San Antonio De Valero later became known as
      the Alamo&nbsp; which you now know started in 1718 it was the first of
      five missions founded in San Antonio to Christianize and educate resident
      Indians the church structure that stands today in the middle of the Alamo,
      After 1835 the Alamo is known as the Cradle of&nbsp; Texas liberty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In 1836 one paper states that a little scared man hid underneath the&nbsp;
      bodies of the defenders of the Alamo till he was catch by Santa Anna and
      Burned!!!&nbsp; Another paper stated that General Cos hated Travis so much
      that after the Siege ended and Cos showed up he ordered for Travis's Slave
      Joe to show him were Travis was and when he found him Cos cut Travis&nbsp;
      up with his sword!</font></em></i></td>

      Before
      any of&nbsp; that happened the siege had to happen which lasted 13 days
      were every man was killed expect for Travis's slave Joe!&nbsp;&nbsp; Among
      those people were Jim Bowie, Davy Crockett, and William Travis but Davy Crockett
      was hang instead of being shot.&nbsp; But Sam Houston didn't make to the Alamo
      in time but at the battle of San Jacinto near Sam Houston Texas the score
      was settled! Santa Anna Surrendered but there is still more so keep
      reading!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      The myth or legend of the Alamo has many different stories to it, I have
      gave you 2 of the many different stories. But all of them helped make
      Texas important.&nbsp; IF you didn't already know the siege lasted 13 days
      from Tuesday February 23. to Sunday March 6, 1836, The siege and Final
      Battle of the Alamo is constituted the most important day in history for
      Texas&nbsp; You probably all ready know the 3 to 4 most important men at
      the Alamo which are David Crockett, William Travis, and James Bowie. The
      men at he Alamo became a symbol of patriotic sacrifice. But the Alamo has
      been rewrote in many different ways for example a movie and plays novels
      and many more but they still show the sacrifice those men at the Alamo
      did.</font></em></i></td>

      Now going back in time into 1835 December 29 were two forts blocked the approach
      of Santa Anna but their effort were unless because Santa Ann's Army over
      powered both of the Fort which names are Goliad at Presido La Bahia and of
      course the Alamo at San Antonio and the third the fort was Bexar just
      across the Rio Grande.&nbsp; In control of Goliad was James Walker fanning
      jr.. And the leader of the Alamo was of course William Travis and General
      Neil was in command of Bexar. Bexar and Goliad were suppose to stop Santa
      Anna Because the Alamo was the key to Texas but Goliad and Bexar couldn't
      stop them so the Alamo was the only thing left to hold them back.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      It was unbelievable that both
      of those forts were taken over by Santa Anna because Both Bexar and Goliad
      had great artillery and men but somehow Santa Anna won .&nbsp; At the
      Alamo though the men there were really neglected but they still fought to
      the death to protect the Mexicans, but most of all to win independence
      from Texas.&nbsp; On Feb 2 bowie wrote to smith saying that he and Neil
      would rather die at the Alamo protecting the Mexican than surrending the Alamo!&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Then Travis wrote to the world that he need help if he was going to win
      against Santa Anna, But no help ever came and he and al of his men died
      protecting the Alamo!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></em></i></td>

      Since 1691 predominantly all of San Antonio was own by the Spanish,&nbsp;
      The Alamo was to be built in honor of the San Antonio De Padua.&nbsp; The
      Alamo had many nicknames like one, Some claim the name really stemmed from
      cottonwood trees that lined the river in front of the church. Anyways by
      the time the Texans got there the old fortress had long been known as the Alamo
      as it Christine name or it really true name San Antonio De Valero. Texas
      was only known as been Governed under the flags of six different
      countries.&nbsp; By 1835 the colonist of tejas declared themselves
      indepented from Mexico. by the end of the siege on the Alamo over 1,000 Mexicans
      but everyone in the Alamo was either died or wounded or soon to be hanged
      like for example David Crockett!&nbsp; But after the Alamo came the Battle
      of San Jacinto were Santa Anna was Captured!&nbsp; And after that Freedom
      was won for the Texans!!!!&nbsp; So always remember the Alamo and never
