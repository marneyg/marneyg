      for seven years. Mauthausen and it's sub camps killed 119,000 prisoners of

      camp. Later on, Mauthausen was known as the &quot;Mother Camp&quot; of all
      Austria. When Mauthausen was first becoming a camp, it was built according
      to the &quot;Dauchau Model&quot; and followed the method of treating prisoners

      camp of Mauthausen was a hospital camp&nbsp;called the &quot;Russian
      Camp&quot;, it was used to hold Soviet prisoners of war. On the opposite
      side of the hospital camp was a camp called the &quot;Tent Camp&quot;.
      Here, there were 16 tents put up in the fall of 1944. They were made to
      hold the large groups of incoming Hungarian&nbsp; Jews. All of these
      smaller parts of the camp and the main camp&nbsp; were surrounded by
      electrified fence. </td>

    <td width="1291" colspan="2">The central camp of Mauthausen consisted of 32 barracks.
      When these barracks became over-filled, the commander, Franz Zieris,
      ordered the surrounding fields&nbsp; be enclosed with barbed-wire fence.
      This is where many Hungarian Jews and Russian prisoners stayed out in the
      open all year round. This is one reason why Mauthausen was known as a
      category three camp which was the worst of the three categories. For the prisoners, a category three camp meant &quot;return not desired&quot; and
      &quot;exterminated by labor&quot;. Beside the outer wall of the camp,
      there were a few stone buildings that served as a kitchen, showers, and
      places where laundry was done. The gas chamber, the place where they were
      burned, and the camp prison were also among these stone buildings.
      Mauthausen's largest sub camp was called Gusen (KZ Gusen) , Gusen was built
      only miles outside of Mauthausen. It was almost as gruesome as Mauthausen.
      Gusen had two sub camps that were settled&nbsp;later on. Gusen II (St.
      Goergen) and Gusen III (Lungitz). The conditions at these two other camps were so bad that the prisoners called them &quot;The Hell of Hell&quot; </td>

    <td width="893">Prisoners at mauthausen were used as forced labor and
      often
      died. During the time in which the war was going on, forced labor was
      important to German armaments production. Most prisoners at Mauthausen&nbsp;
      went through a system in which the Nazi's picked out the ones that were
      too weak or ill to perform extreme labor, they were then exterminated.
      There were many ways an inmate could die, such as being shot, being
      hanged, beaten, starvation, and diseases. But Mauthausen did indeed have a
      gas-chamber that could murder 120 inmates per time. Another method of
      killing inmates, and one of the SS men's favorite ways, in the winter was
      to make inmates get naked. Then the SS men sprayed them with cold water
      until the prisoners froze to death. They died very easily because the
      average temperature was around 10 degrees Celsius. Another method favored
      by the SS men, was throwing inmates off the edge of the rock
      quarry. This was a way where inmates were killed very cheaply. The place
      where most prisoners jumped was called &quot;The Parachutist's
      Wall&quot;. Another way than inmates were killed cheaply was by heart
      injections. 420 Jewish children from 4 to 7&nbsp; were murdered in this
      way. Also another way y which inmates were killed painfully was by
      showering in the winters, and starvation. An average working day for prisoners&nbsp;started
      at 4:45 A.M.(5:15 A.M. in the winter), and ended at 7:00P.M. Most of the
      ways prisoners were painful but a way that was almost to unbearable but
      mostly used for punishment was by &quot;Hanging Inmates In The
      Trees&quot;. The inmates were taken to a tree and hung by their arms
      behind their backs. Most times they&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time they were
      forgotten and died only 30 minutes later. &quot;Bathing inmates to
      Death&quot; was a cruel way to murder inmates. In this technique, 40 to 200
      prisoners were taken the showers, here S.S. men exposed them to ice cold
      water. This method was created by Karl Chielewski. Not many but a few
      prisoners were drowned in huge tubs. Also many prisoners were forced to
      walk up 186 carrying<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>while
      holding 100 pounds on their backs, and if one person dropped theirs it
