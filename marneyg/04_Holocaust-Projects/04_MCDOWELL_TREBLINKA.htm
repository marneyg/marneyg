      make the Jews in. They also used them to feed gas in. Another way to kill
      them was to burn them. An incinerator was located about 10m away from the
      gas chambers. The incinerator had a shape of about 20m long 1m deep. Rails
      that extended across the top were used to lay bodies on, and burn. A
      series of furnaces were aligned along the rails to burn the bodies. About
      1000 bodies were burned simultaneously. After the procedure some bodies
