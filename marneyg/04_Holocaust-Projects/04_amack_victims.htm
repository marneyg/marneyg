      Many children experienced something most people can't understand. They
      were killed just as much as adults were. Parents tried hard to find&nbsp;
      a safe spot for their children, and a lot were successful, but others were
      not. Children being sheltered in a Children's Home in Iziez wrote letters
      and prayers to parents and God. Small, little Georges Halpern wrote to his
      mother saying, &quot;Chere Maman, I send you 10,000,000,000 kisses. your
      son who loves you very much.&quot; A lot of secret children's home were
      never found by the Nazi's but some did. April 6, 1944, the Children's Home
      in Izieu was raided. The Nazi's threw crying and terrified children onto
      trucks and deported them all to Auschwitz were every single one was
      killed. This is the story for almost all kids who were found.</p>

      persecuted for many centuries before the Holocaust. Gypsies had the same
      treatments as the Jews had during the Holocaust; at first they were
      deprived of their civil rights, then deportation to camps, and finally
      murder. Most Gypsies were sent to live in ghettos and had to face firing
      squads. Some were even used as guinea pigs and had lethal substances
      injected into them. Many Roma that were from the East, like Russia, Poland,
      and Balkan, were shot by the Einsatzgruppen. At Machsenhausen, a
      concentration camp, Gypsies were tormented with &quot; special
      experiments&quot;&nbsp; to scientifically prove that their blood was
      different than Germans, the perfect race. For efficiency, Gypsies were
      shot naked looking at their pre-dug graves. According to many Nazi
      shooters, Jews were easier to shoot than Gypsies because Jews stood still,
      but Gypsies would run around constantly howling and crying out, some would
      even jump into the graves and pretend to be dead. Even the ones hat were
      exempted from this treatment because of marriage to a German were
      sterilized. The end result; hundreds of thousands of Gypsies were killed
      during the Holocaust because they were considered &quot;work-shy&quot; and
      &quot;asocial&quot; by the Germans.&nbsp;</p>

      Before World War 1 there weren't very many Black people in Germany. During
      ww1, France brought Black soldiers in during France's occupation of
      Germany. Since there were different colored people living in Germany, the
      Nazis forcibly sterilized offspring between black men and white women
      because it held back the campaign for the perfect race. Children that had
      a black father and a white mother were mulatto&nbsp; children because of
      their color. Mostly every Germans despised them and called them ugly
      names. Hitler wrote,&quot; These mulatto children came through rape or
      their mother was a whore. In both cases there is not the slightest moral
      duty regarding these offspring of a foreign race.&quot; This is what
      happened to children because of the color of their skin.</p>

      According to Hitler's new way of thinking, many people were persecuted,
      tortured, and executed because the master race had no room for these
      &quot;impure&quot; people. Hitler even looked through his very own men and
      found suspected homosexuals, they were sent to concentration camps wearing
      medals and S.S. uniforms. Homosexuals were forced to wear pink triangles
      for further humiliation in camps and easy identification.</p>

      In the
      beginning of WWII, Jews were, at first, restricted from going to cinemas,
      theaters, swimming pools and resorts. Jewish papers were suspended and
      Jews had to have identification cards including having to wear the Star of
      David. Jewish children were banned from schools and curfews were put on
      the Jews to cut of traveling time. Over all Jews were banned from most
      public places. Six million Jews died from being in ghettos, by being
      killed by mobile squads, or being sent to concentration and death camps
      because of one single reason; they were Jewish. At the end of 1945, close
      to 2 out of 3 European Jews had been killed because of the &quot;Final
      Solution.&quot;</p>

      Christian Poles and many other Slavic people were also targets for Nazi
      hatred during WWII. To the Nazi's they were considered ,subhuman, nothing
      more than a thing in the way for a superior German Race. They were sent to
      forced labor camps and sentenced to annihilation. No matter your stance in
      public views, you were sent to camps if you were of Slavic people. The
      Nazi's thirst for more living space ended up as a disaster to Polish,
      Ukrainian, and Byelorussia populations.

      There was no room for people who had obvious problems. Many were
      sterilized because of their imperfection. The &quot;Euthanasia
      Program&quot; was made for this certain killing project. Hitler
      thought there wasn't a need to waste money and time to support the
      handicapped. This &quot;cleansing program&quot; put these men and women to
      death like cats and dogs. The whole plan was to be secret but word got out
      that their relatives were being killed. Doctors were told to kill off
      patients with disabilities by starvation, poisoning, and injection with
      deadly chemicals. These totally innocent people died because of their
      disabilities that they were born with.&nbsp;

      &quot;I was a hidden child, from ages three to five. I am grateful to her

      Burks' father took her to a woman's house one day when Hitler started to
      kill the Jews. She lost a great deal of her childhood because she was a
      Jew being persecuted. She remembers always being scared. No toys, huge, or
      kisses that was her life for two years. &quot;I was never allowed to have
      a father. I don't have a picture of my family except for one little
      picture of my father and me. Her father was sent to Auschwitz. &quot;And
      all because he was a Jew. He never killed anyone. Never robbed anyone, yet
      they murdered him. They exterminated him simply because he was a
      Jew.&quot;</p>

      After the war they were very poor. Her mother died in February 1950 from
      breast cancer. Jeanine was only ten. After her brother and sister wanted
      to send her to America so she could have a better life. &quot;Leaving Belgium
      was the most traumatic thing that had ever happened to me. I was close to
      my brother and sister. To me it looked as if they did not want me anymore
      now that they were married.&quot; She had a wonderful life, got married
      twice and had six kids. &quot;People ask me can I forgive? I can't. I
      cannot forgive. I blame the German people a great deal because I feel they
      were passive. They turned away. They may have the audacity to say they did
      not know. That is not acceptable. Until they can own up to it , I can't
      forgive.&quot;

      from Radom, Poland. He had a big family. They owned cattle and butchered
      them at their home, which is illegal. When the Germans went invaded
      Poland, Isak ran away to Russia, where he joined the army after Hitler
      invaded Russia. The army sent him to a town where they were captured. When
      they surrendered he changed his name to Broniewski, which was a Polish
      name. When he was marching to a camp he escaped and a woman took him in.
      Then he joined the Partisans, but before he got a chance to fight, a good
      friend got drunk and he told the Nazis' many names. Isak was arrested.
      Since he looked like a Jew, he was sent to the death chamber. In there a
      girl, Ira Pogorlskaja, kept him alive by giving food and protected him
      against the other prisoners when he was ill. One day they took her out of
      the chamber and she never returned. After the war he tried to find her,
      but she was never seen again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      the death chamber he was tortured. Given cold showers, beat with leather
      straps until his skin turned the color of wood. Then they started
      believing he was just a Russian soldier so they put him in a regular cell.
      The Army was coming near so they sent them to Auschwitz, but they didn't
      have any room for them to Auschwitz, but they didn't have any room for
      them there. So they went to Mauthausen were he was sent to the camp
      hospital because he was sick. In the hospital a Pole noticed that he was a
      Jew and wanted to help him. He sent him to a sub-camp where he worked at a
      factory. Then one day the factory exploded. So he was sent to Linz III to
      cut out tank wheels. &quot;They made you feel like an animal. It was a
      slaughterhouse. Absolutely not describable.&quot; While he was working, a
      guard was going to shoot him to make the other workers work harder. Then
      another guard said,&quot; He is a soldier just like you, a soldier who
      wants to go home to his family.&quot; They soon put him in a Bomb Kommando,
      where he had to dig up unexploded bombs. When the American Army got near
      the guards had to get rid of the workers. So they decided to take them
      back to camp. When they got to Wels they were set free by the Americans.
      Then he started home but was told to join the Army. When he got out of the
      Army he went back home. Everything looked exactly like he left it. He
      found his brother, but could barely recognize him. &quot;Hoe do I deal with
      it? By just going and praying. I get up at 5:30 a.m. I go to work. I make
      myself busy. I remember nothing.&quot; Sometimes I try to go back to my
      past, and it's unbelievable for me. Sometimes I think I am just dreaming.&quot;

      Some people forget times like those, but the people who survived it, never
      will. The Holocaust has many memories that cannot just fade away from
      time, but will live as long as there are people who remember it. The
      Holocaust just wasn't a time in history that teachers teach about, it was a
      living nightmare for the many people who experienced it. </p>
