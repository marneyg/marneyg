      the Jews in Europe. Hitler's Anti- Semitic ideas were so strong that he
      released hatred by mass murder. Before Hitler decided to become dictator
      the Final Solution was already in his head. In a couple of books written
      by Gerald Fleming Hitler says '' Once I&nbsp; am really in power my first
      task will be the genocide of the Jews .'' He achieved his goal by killing
      six million Jews. Hitler began&nbsp; the final solution in every European
      Nation he was&nbsp; control of. The Jews were sent to concentration/death
      camps.

      were taken to death camps. Auschwitz mainly. They killed 1 to 3 million
      people there. '' Under proper guidance in the Final Solution the Jews are to
      be relocated for appropriate&nbsp; labor in the east. Able-bodied Jews
      will be separated according to sex. Then taken in large work columns to
      work on roads of course many will die of natural causes.'' Himmler said
      this during the conference.</td>

      <p>The Holocaust did not happen a day. It grew for 2000 years
      un till it peaked. Weather Hitler was there or not to take advantage of
      the moment . Or weather he was there to cause it to peak is debatable. It
      happened because nobody would stop it. 'The killing stopped in 1944 the
      anti-Semitism did not''. Anti-Semitism led to the final solution. Which
      was the Nazis plan to kill all the Jews in Europe. It was carried out by
      killing squads ,ghettos, and camps. The Final Solution was personal but it
      was also a project. It was not just the actions of Hitler but a plan
      carried out by the world. ''Jews are not humans''. Or that's what some of
      the soldiers said. With a national precipitation it was easy for cruel and
      mean acts to be committed. Nazis rounded up Jehovah's witnesses and homo sexual
      and sent them to cams to be gassed. Homo Sexual were forced to wear a pink
      triangle periling the star of David.</p>

      clothes and shaved of all their body hair. Then they were given a shower, disinfected
      and given a uniform. each step was used to dehumanize prisoners, both physically
      and emotionally. Prisoners were then given a number. At Auschwitz the
      number was tattooed on their arm. Those who the Nazis thought were unable
      to work were token to what they called showers. The Nazis said to these prisoners
      who were about to meet their deaths it was to freshen up a bit after their
      long journey. Instead of water Zyklon B, developed to kill rodents, closed
      in on them. Death Did not usually come quickly but rather slowly. Most of
      the walls of the death chambers had scratch marks to show how victims
      tried to dig themselves out. The purpose of these cams were to kill huge
      amounts of Jews a day. Camps had been in Germany for years. These were the
      places&nbsp; were tons of Jews had been murdered. Once at the camps
      selected people would work the others were gassed. Before being gassed
      they forced to march to the sound of music. An important camp was
      Treblinka. It was established for slave labor In 1941, but in 1942 it
      became a death camp. By may 1943 the population of Warsaw had been
      transported to Treblinka and other camps. By July 11, 1944 800,000 Jews
      had been murdered in Treblinkia. Unlike Treblinkia, Chelmno, Sobibor, and Balzac
      which were made to kill Jews. Maidanek and Auschwitz had a work camp
      attached. Upon arrival at these two camps a selection was made. 10% of the
      new arrivals would escape immediate gassing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

      then he branded and labeled them as if they were cattle. Then he sent them

      most of the Jewish population in Germany would be sent to camps. Nazis
      racial policies took over everything to try and find a solution for the
      Jewish question. the Nazis tried to separate them and force migration but
      when this did not work they found a final solution to the Jewish question.
      This was the murdering of the Jews in Europe. No-one knows when this
      decision was made but when the ghettos were built Heydrich said '' this is
      one step closer to the final aim''.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

      force the Jews to immigration. In 1940 the nazis planed to ship the Jews
      to an Island in the Indian ocean called Madagascar. it was not until later
      they referred to the Final Solution as genocide rather than territorial
      Final Solution. As the nazis were under cover of the war they developed
      technology to successfully murder millions of Jews. details were worked
      out at the Wansee Conference. All Jews in Germanys occupied countries were
      sent to ghettos as holding areas. Many were sent to camps were they worked
      under brutal conditions. Many were sent to gas chambers. As the Allies
      advanced death marches cut down the number of potential survivors. Some of
      Hitler's objectives were to wage to wars at once one aimed at anyone who
      objected him the other at the Jews. Hitler's success was credited to
      planed steps and reaction to those of other world powers.&nbsp; </td>
