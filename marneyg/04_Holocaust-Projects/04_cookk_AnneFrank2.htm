      are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo, or Nazi police, is treating
      them very roughly and transporting them in cattle cars to Westerbork, the
      big camps in Drenthe to which they're sending all the Jews..... If it's
      that bad in Holland, what must it be like in those faraway and uncivilized
      places where the Germans are sending them? We assume that most of them are
      murdered. The English radio says they're being gassed.&quot;</font></td>
