      Poles, and Cypsis. Thousands who ended up in these ghettos died of
      starvation and disease. And those who survived the horrible conditions of
      the ghettos were deported to labor camps, concentration camp, or death
      camps. He hoped that the abominable conditions in the ghettos would
      deplete Jewish population quickly and haturally through starvation,
      disease, and cold. The ghetto server as a holding area for eventual
      transportation to the death camps for the hardy ones who survied brutal
      conditions. There was no medicine permitted in the ghettos. The food
      ration allowed to inhabited was a quarer of that avaible enoug to permit
      survival. Where one hundred and sixty thousand people where packed into a
      smaller than three square miles. When Eichmann forced another
      twenty-thousand into Lodz, the district commissioner Naively complained
      that he must have had inaccurate information about the capacity of the
      ghetto. One hundred and twenty thousand Jews in the Lodz ghetto died of
      starvation. The Jews who where not forced into ghettos where condemend to
      Poland's 300 Labor camps. Throughout most of the war, Eichmann was the top
      official of a bureaurray, and murder millions of Jews. It is generally
      belived that the number of Jews who died in the Holocaust was six million.
      Five milion others also perished as a result of Nazi artocities. </td>

    <td width="971">At an October 1941 meeting where Eichmann was present, a
      decision was made to use poison gas to kill Jews. Auschwitz, a camp in
      Poland, was chosen to test this new method, and it was Eichmann who met
      with the Auschwitz commandont Radoph Hoess, to accomplish this. He would
      travel from occupied country and assist in making the arrangments for the
      Jews to be slaughtered. Fifteen high ranking Nazi officak were in
      attedance, include Heydrich, for whom Eichmann prepared the conferen's
      opening speech. At this meeting, the Third Reich adopted a plam to deport
      Jews to death camps, in what he came known as the &quot; Final
      Solution.&quot; Most of the debate centered not on the morality of this,
      but rather what proportion of Jewish blood would merit this special
      treatment and the methods used to effect genocide Heydrich made it clear
      that all organizational and logistical requirements would be the
      responibility of Adolf Eichmann. According to Eichmann, it was he who
      coined the term &quot;Final Solution&quot; to mean annihilation of the
      Jewish people. By 1941, Hitler ordered that all Jews in the Reich be
      killed. A written order to that effect was found to be sent from Gestapo
      Chief Hermann&nbsp; Goerring to Heydrich. Eichmann, as the Nazi war
      machine's Jewish expens was the central instrument in the German war
      bureaucracy to see that this order was fulfilled. In his Sassen interveiws,
      Eichmann took the credit for drafting Goerring's directive. According to
      ore high on the list of war criminals who would be dealt withfollowing the
      inevitable Allied victory. By the time war broke out in September
      1939,Eichmann was running the central offices. He was promoted almost
      annually , eventually achieving the rank of Lt. Colonel of the S.S. (S.S
      oberstrumbannfuehrer) by 1941. Stories ciroulated about his arrogance - -
      even that he periodicarit&nbsp; challenged superion officers to share his
      vision with respect to the &quot;Jewish problem&quot; </td>

    <td width="971">In June of 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Special
      German units called einsatzergappen followed immediately behind the
      advancing troops. An estimated 1.4 million Jews were murdered by the
      Einsatzergruppen. All reports about their activities went to Eichmann.
      Einsatzerguppen's methods of mass murder were inefficienty and it was
      Eichmann's duty to develop and imp;ement methods to haster the
      annihilation of the Jews under Nazi occupation. The Crooked Shall Be Made
      Straghit! The Eichmann Trail, the Jewish Catastrophe, and Hannah Arendt's
      Narrtive. The seventh million: The I sraelis and the Holocaust. At his
      trial in Nuremberg, Goerring denied that the words in the directive meant
      that the Jews were to be killed. With the war seemingly lost, Eichmann set
      to work with two goals in mind; destroying all documents he could find
      human histroy, and murding as many Jews as could be accomplished before
      the cover of war was lifted. </td>
