      Every single non-Jewish being had been moved out by October 30th.&nbsp;
      The Warsaw Ghetto residents were sealed from the outside world by brick
      and cement. Walls were 10 feet tall and topped with barbed wire and broken
      glass.&nbsp; The walls were closely guarded by Polish Nazi officers.&nbsp;Everyone
      was nervous, because they were scared they would break a rule and get
      shot. No one could have talk to there friends that were Aryans, because if
      they did they were shot on sight. This was just the beginning. They were
      often beat if they didn't listen to orders right way or if they asked
      question with out being asked a question first.</td>

      from the information about Chelmno gassing Jews. Some also went into panic
      because of the fact that more and more gassing centers were opening.&nbsp;
      Some received secret information that Jews were lied to and told that they
      were going to take showers and were put in a chamber ,but instead gasses
      ,such as Zyklon B, were poured in to the chambers. Others were told that
      they were going to go to &quot;educational&quot; camps, but were taken to
      ghettos or concentration and death camps. Jews were lied to and taken away
      from there families and friends.</td>

      more.&nbsp; Jews were told that they were going to live in ''Jewish Residential
      Quarters&quot; and they would be a decent and quiet place to&nbsp; live
      and raise their children.&nbsp; The ghetto was made to hold the Jews until
      they were shipped out to camps.&nbsp; The ghetto contained about 250,000
      people and only 100,000 housing units.&nbsp; Up to 7 families in one home
      meant for 1 family.&nbsp; The walls in the houses became green and slimy
      and carried diseases from families there before.&nbsp; Life really was a
      terrible as it seemed. </td>

      180 grams of bread a day and 220 grams of sugar a month.&nbsp; They were
      only allowed 1kg. of jam and honey as well.&nbsp; People snuck food
      through fences, gates, sewers, and homes close to or on the boarder
      walls.&nbsp; Many six year old boys were sent over the wall to get
      food.&nbsp; They would grab packages from pedestrians and eat the contents
      while they ran.&nbsp; Meats and cheeses were very rare and expensive to
      buy.&nbsp; People sometimes died in fights over a small portion of
      food.&nbsp; Children were killed by adults for food. If caught with
      outside food you were immediately shot. Many personal belongings were
      traded for little amounts of&nbsp; food. Yet, while all this Chaos went on
      loving, caring parents still found time to educate their children.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

      camps there was a rebellion. It was the night of&nbsp; January 18, 1943.
      The residents remaining at the ghetto formed a group called Z.O.B. Which
      in Polish means Zydowska Organizacia Bojowa which in English translates to
      Jewish Fighting Organization.&nbsp; The Z.O.B. held off the Nazis for
      about a month or about 4 weeks while the Nazis took over the entire rest
      of Poland in the same amount of time.&nbsp; In the beginning of the fight
      the Nazis quickly lost, by 2a.m. there was not a single live Nazi left in
      the ghetto, but&nbsp; they came back with much more ammunition. Everyone
      in the ghetto was quiet the only noise was the air-bombs.&nbsp;When the
      Nazis come back they killed many Jews. They burnt down the synagogues,
      torched the hospitals, and shot everyone in bed as well.&nbsp; After the
      fight the ghetto was burning with flames and people were burnt
      alive,&nbsp; others died of lack of oxygen because of all the smoke
      fumes.&nbsp; Broken glass covered the streets.&nbsp; </td>
