      camp Auschwitz.&nbsp; The nick name for the town Oswiecim was Auschwitz,
      that is how the camp got it's name.&nbsp; Auschwitz was the most famous
      death camp and was a symbol of fear in all Jewish eyes.&nbsp; Not only
      Jews where killed in this death camp but also gypsies, soviet war
      prisoners, and any others that where not the wright religion.&nbsp; Rudolph Hess&nbsp;
      had the job to fit about 30,000 inmates into this camp,
      and he went above and beyond and ended up fitting about 100,000
      inmates.&nbsp; Out of the prisoners captured 25% of them went to
      forced labor camps, and the other 75% where immediately sent to there
      death beds.&nbsp; The S.S. officers soon started to think that the war
      would soon be over and began destroying any evidence they stumbled upon.&nbsp; The
      prisoners where evidence so they had to also be destroyed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      guess was 1,000,000 where killed, 670 barely escaped
      Auschwitz alive, and 270 who attempted escape where caught and
      killed.&nbsp; When January 27, 1945 came around a huge relief for the reminder of
      prisoners left in Auschwitz, because that day they where freed by The Red
      Army.</td>

      these prisoners where to get out of Belzec.&nbsp; This is the story

      Talenfeld.&nbsp; They slipped away and hid in a ditch the whole night until no one was
      looking.&nbsp; Then the started to run for there lives.&nbsp; Here is
      another storie.&nbsp; Sara Ritter ( a four year old ) was hidden in a
      bread basket where then her uncle tried to sneak her out.&nbsp; He was
      later found and shot, but the young girl lived.&nbsp; She was able to stay
      with a family in a near by town.&nbsp; Belzec was responsible for a guess
      of about 600,000 to about 800,000 killings.&nbsp; These prisoners where
      lucky not to be in that count.&nbsp; </td>

      city of Lublin. The camp was built in an open area where the public could
      see the camp, and they didn't even try to hid this camp from the
      people.&nbsp; In October of 1941 was when this camp opened.&nbsp; Majdanek
      was suppose to hold 25,000 inmates to about 50,000 inmates, but a new plan
      came about and the camp would be made to hold almost 250,000
      prisoners.&nbsp; There where seven gas chambers in Majdanek that would use
      the gas Zyklon B.&nbsp; These gas chambers started up in 1942.&nbsp; A lot
      of the prisoners died in these gas chambers and the others who did not die
      of starving to death, dirty living areas, or they would be
      shot.&nbsp; After the picked up the dead bodies they would be puy in a
      cremator.&nbsp; Cremators where brought into Majdanek in 1943.&nbsp; They
      where good to have because they got rid of the evidence of dead bodies.
      During he day prisoners where assigned jobs one assigned to the women was
      to separate the different parts of the shoe and put them into piles.&nbsp;
      Many of the others had to do horrible fiscal labor and that normally ended
      up to mean death.&nbsp; On October of 1943 the inmates had to dig three
      huge trenches.&nbsp; Then in November of 1943 the inmates where assigned
      to a trench where they would be shot.&nbsp; Over one day 18,000 where killed
      in one of the biggest one day killings.&nbsp; This was named the Harvest
      Festival.&nbsp; On July 24,1944 when the Soviet Troops finally arrived
      almost 500,000 killings had accorded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b> </td>

      Poland.&nbsp; Unlike some other camps this camp was out of the people's
      view.&nbsp; Most of the prisoners in Sobibor felt like no one cared and that
      they where forgotten.&nbsp; Train tracks where next to the and they would dump of
      prisoners at the camp.&nbsp; When the inmates first got to camp Sobibor they lost all
      of there stuff even there hair,&nbsp; although some didn't have the chance
      to be humiliated because they where sent straight to the gas chambers.&nbsp;
      The camp soon began to grow and so did the gas chambers. There was three
      then it went to six.&nbsp; There was a problem with the inmates on October
      14, of 1943.&nbsp; They where getting restless and started to cause an up
      rising.&nbsp; This was the reason the camp shut down.&nbsp; Sixty was the
      guess of&nbsp; how many survived and over 260,000 died in camp Sobibor.&nbsp;
      Sobibor lasted for over one bad year, from May of 1942 to October of

      camp.&nbsp; They didn't have to suffer long, but&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      some did suffer long and painful deaths.&nbsp; On
