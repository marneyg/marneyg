    <td width="100%">Josef Mengele was born on March 16, 1911 in Gunzburg,
      Germany.&nbsp; His parents were Karl and Walburga Mengele. While growing
      up Josef's nickname was Beppo.&nbsp; Josef was the oldest of his two other
      brothers, Karl and Alois. As a young man Josef was admired as a bright
      ambitious student.&nbsp; His teachers would often compliment him on his
      knowledge of conduct and punctuality. When Josef got old enough Josef's
      dad wanted Josef to take over the family factory. While growing up Josef
      wished of&nbsp; someday of having a career in science and anthropology. In
      1930 Josef graduated from Gunzburg. He passed his college exam well enough
      to be accepted to the university of Munich, Bavaria.</td>

      when he crashed on his motorcycle.&nbsp; When the prisoners got off the
      train Josef would be waiting for them.&nbsp; A flick of Josef's cane could
      mean death or forced labor.&nbsp; A flick to the right meant work. A flick
      to the left meant gas chambers. Josef's main goal or objective was to
      create the perfect Aryan race.&nbsp; Josef Mengele was responsible for
      killing thousands of Jews a day.&nbsp; Josef made a game out of walking
      the children to the chimneys. He called it &quot;Walking to the
      chimney.&quot;&nbsp; Children would often be given X-rays for any broken
      limbs. Then Josef would walk in and give them some candy, then he would
      inject them for his experiments.&nbsp; At Auschwitz Josef was given the
      nickname &quot;Angel of Death.&quot;&nbsp; Josef's goal was to perform
      experiments on human genetics.&nbsp; Josef was the only doctor at
      Auschwitz to have served in the army.

      pits to be dug, filled with gasoline, and set aflame.&nbsp; Then the Jews
      would be pushed into the fires and burned to death.&nbsp; One specific
      event was ten trucks drove up to the pits with children in the them.&nbsp;
      The trucks backed up to the pits and threw the children into the
      flames.&nbsp; Then officers would go around with sticks and push the ones
      that got out back into the flames.&nbsp; Josef was allowed to operate on
      whoever he wanted whenever he wanted.&nbsp; Josef and another doctor loved
      to experiment on the twins.&nbsp; Some survivors said &quot;Dr. Mengele
      just didn't work at Auschwitz, he was Auschwitz.&quot;&nbsp; The people
      Josef liked working on the most was twins, dwarves, and people with
      deformalities. Other doctors would hold the Jews down while Josef would
      inject dye into their eyes.&nbsp; This often caused patients to go blind
      or have massive pains.&nbsp; One of Mengele's experiments was to inject
      diseases into twins to see what it did to them when they were alive and to
      see what happened to them when they were dead.&nbsp; Often Josef would
      remove the eyes of some of his patients and pin them to the walls of his
      office.

      revolving gas chamber, which represented flying at high altitudes,&nbsp;
      to see what the body did.&nbsp; Prisoners would often throw themselves
      against the walls to die a less painful death.&nbsp; Another gruesome
      experiment of Josef's was to inject chloroform into a child's heart.&nbsp;
      Or sewing twins together to try and make Siamese twins.&nbsp; No one knew
      why Josef became so mean or so ruthless.&nbsp; Josef died before he could
      be interviewed and asked why he did what he did.&nbsp; Josef left
      Auschwitz on January 17, 1945. The Soviet Union was advancing towards
      Berlin.&nbsp; Josef and Irene went to Gunzburg.&nbsp; Josef visited his
      parents.&nbsp; He also saw his 8 month old son Rolf.&nbsp; Then on Nov. 6
      he returned to Auschwitz.&nbsp; Then he fled westward with a retreating
      bunch of Wehrmacht soldiers.&nbsp; With them he traded his SS uniform for
      a Wehrmacht's.&nbsp; On May 2,&nbsp; 1945 the same day Hitler shot
      himself, Josef joined a field hospital unit.&nbsp; Mengele was captured by
      allied forces and taken to a city called Ingolstadt.

      He borrowed one of the bikes and rode to Donauworth. Josef stashed his
      I.D. papers inside the handlebar of the bike and used his friend's I.D.
      papers. But when Josef returned the bike to the farmer he forgot his I.D.
      papers and was forced to live under the name Fritz Ulmann.&nbsp; In 1949
      Josef escaped to Argentina. In 1954 Josef received a visit from his dad,
      Karl Mengele.&nbsp; Also that same year Josef and Irene got a
      divorce.&nbsp; In 1958 Josef married his brother's widow Martha Mengele.&nbsp;
      In South Africa Josef was scared to live by himself, so he bought half of
      a Sierra Negro Farm.&nbsp; Josef and the other people that lived there
      didn't get along real well.&nbsp; Mengele became paranoid, he thought that
      they'd turn him in.&nbsp; In 1972 Josef became very ill. It was later
      discovered that Josef had swallowed a lot of hair and the hair was
      blocking his intestines. In the hospital Mengele was almost discovered.
      But his friend told the doctor a lie about Josef's identity. </td>

      Martha.&nbsp; In 1973 Josef asked Rolf if he'd like to visit.&nbsp; After
      4 years Rolf decided to take the long trip to Brazil.&nbsp; On Nov. 9,1970
      the president of West Germany didn't know what had become of Josef.&nbsp;
      So he issued a $50,000 and$10,000,000 reward for the capture of Josef
      Mengele.&nbsp; They said &quot;Josef is to good for death.&quot;&nbsp;
      Josef became the number one wanted man everywhere.&nbsp; When people
      mentioned Josef's name they were either left in awe or scared to
      death.&nbsp; Some even said that anyone who followed Josef was almost
      certain to die.&nbsp; On January 17, 1985 a group of Auschwitz survivors
      gathered in Jerusalem to testify against Josef.&nbsp;</td>

      lifelong friend of Josef's was captured and interviewed. Through letters
      of other people they captured they were able to find where Josef was
      buried.&nbsp; After DNA tests they confirmed that it was Josef Mengele. On
      January 7, 1979 Josef went for a swim off the beach of Bertioga in Embu,
      Brazil.&nbsp; While Josef was swimming he had a stroke, he started to
      drown but was saved by some other people.&nbsp; But they weren't soon
      enough.&nbsp; Josef Mengele the &quot;Angel Of Death&quot; was dead.&nbsp;
      On Josef's headstone it read Wolfgang Gerhard instead of Josef Mengele. It
      wasn't until the mid 1980's until people discovered Josef's death.&nbsp;
      His body was later dug up for scientific research.</td>
