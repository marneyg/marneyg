      later that year he became head of the Nazi Party. Eventually the party
      grew from just a little 100 man club to 1000's of men in a political
      party. But hitler and the Nazi party had to get something to be able to
      start the Depression as well as World War Two. First Hitler had to make
      just a party into a government in order to do this Hitler had to get votes
      from the country so he started with speeches propaganda as well as
      anything to do with politics. Hitler's main goal was to become Chancellor of Germany. </td>

    <td width="100%" colspan="2" height="232">It was in 1919 that Anton Drexler, Gottfried Felder, and
      Dietrich Eckart started the Nazi Party. When Hitler joined the Nazi Party
      in 1921 he became there head speaker and he knew that the party could not afford
      to lose him so he decided to Advocate the name change the name} to
      National Socialist German Workers Party. Though the years he finally
      became head of the Nazi Party and decided to make a political paper on the
      rules of the Party. It was called the 25 points it stated that the party
      refused to accept the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. in the 25 points
      was stated that Germany refused to pay the debt to the rest of the world.
      Because of this the world was short of money for spending it on World War
      One. This made allot of inflation because of job cuts because companies could not afford to pay the workers for their
      work's e people out of jobs
      making even harder to buy food to survive this hurt very many families because they could not afford to provide for themselves. &nbsp; </td>

    <td width="100%" colspan="2" height="209">So while all the courtiers in the world were in big debt
      Hitler was planning his way to become Chancellor. This was a prime time to
      try for it. What Hitler did was promised the country of Germany that all of
      them got food and jobs in doing this he became a big factor in Germany.
      Everyone was hungry and wanted jobs to support themselves so they believed
      Hitler. So when he pretty much took control of Germany he started
      factories back to make weapons and started building up the military {which
      in the Treaty of Versailles it stated that Germany was not supposed to
      have weapons and that the military could not be more than 200,000 men
      which the 25 points defied} When he began to build his military up he made
      his own personal bodyguards called the Sa. The SA started violence on the
      streets. The fights strarted as small dog fights to fights between
      diffrent political parties.This scared the people of Germany so in later
      elections he and the nazi party lost votes. </td>
