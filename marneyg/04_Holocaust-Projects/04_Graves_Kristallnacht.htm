      Vom Rath, a third secretary, in the German Embassy because of how poorly
      they had treated his family by making them move. So Hitler decided this to
      be a reason to blame the Jews and be rude to them to get them out of his
      country. Among the deportees to the Polish border was Zindel Grynszpan, Herschel's
      father, who was born in Poland and moved to Hannover
      where he started a small store in 1911.</td>

      cards. Richard Wheilheimer and Marqulies both experienced Kristallnacht and
      here are there stories.
      <p>In Ludwigshafen, Germany, 65 years ago, Richard Wheilheimer looked down
      to a horrific scene taking place a few stories below. shop keepers were
      being dragged out of there homes in the night gowns, children beaten and
      store fronts smashed. It was almost his families turn as the mob forcibly
      opened the door and hauled away his father. 'It was like humanity gone
      berserk!&quot; recalled Wheilheimer, Now 71 living in Port, Washington.
      &quot;Afterwards my mother took me and my brother and we walked the
      streets not knowing what was going on.&quot; When they returned to out
      apartment after witnessing there own synagogue in flames, all of there
      furniture and dishes had been destroyed. thee clothes&nbsp; were piled
      high in the middle of there floor and&nbsp; and covered with ink and other
      liquids including molasses, the sent of which still haunt him. He also
      remembers the sound of broken glass and businesses being looted. An
      estimated 100 people were killed, hundreds of synagogues burned,7,500 businesses
      destroyed and 30,00 Jewish men arrested many of whom were sent to
      concentration camps. If it wasn't clear before that the final solution was
      coming this was really a clarification of what the plans were in terms of
      the Jews from the German economic life.</td>

      two weeks earlier, to the camp Zbaszyn, and so his mother had made a plan
      to meet up in case of an emergency. While waiting for his sister at that
