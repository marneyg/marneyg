      concentration camp made. Dachau was created because prisons had to many
      people that the government didn't like . They didn't have enough money to
      build more prisons like we do in our wars so the Nazis built work camps
      like Dachau. Dachau opened on March 22,1933. Dachau is located 8 miles
      outside the city of Munich, Germany. The camp was a training center for SS
      guards and the camps organization and routine became the model for all
      Nazi concentration camps. German citizens had little knowing of the harsh
      and bruttle things that had been happening inside the Concentration camp
      of Dachau.</p>

      the middle of July he remembers sweat running down his face but on the
      inside he was froze. Javed says that when he goes to heaven he
      will be able to tell everyone that he took a trip to&nbsp; HELL. He says
      its not even anything you can imagine picture a prison then think of a
      prison that worked them one hundred times worse that's what it was like in
      the concentration camp of Dachau. I was like a walking skeleton I remember
      the longest I went with out food was about 15 days then I finally got a
      piece of bread from the German citizens outside the gate. &quot; I will
      never forget my long hell like trip to Dachau.&quot;David Orlinoffspeakes
      out about Dachau, &quot;I have pictures of Dachau in 1945, however my
      pictures show the rooms with blind stained walls where the SS threw
      starved men, women and children. I also have the blast furnaces where they
      cremated the bodies of people murdered by gas. The stack of the furnace is
      somewhat taller in 45, the building is the same. My photos are black and
      white&nbsp; and were taken the day the camp was liberated.</p>

                  with a Dachau survivor.</i></p>
                  <p align="left"><i>Last summer, my girlfriend and I took a
                  backpacking trip through Europe. After an Amazing two months
                  bumming around Greece, Italy, Switzerland, France, Austria,
                  and Prague, we finally&nbsp; arrived in Munich. Our visit to Dacha
                  was deeply disturbing but a valuable experience nonthingless.
                  Our new friend Oskar (the Dachau survivor) had brought along
                  photographs of the camp from 1945. The blood stained walls,
                  the filthy bodies piled on top of each other, the heartless
                  prison guards.... it was all too much. I have never felt such
                  powerful emotion. I couldn't bring myself to Photographic copy
                  of one of his photographs of the living quarters. This was the
                  photograph that induced such intense and emotional response in
                  ,me the previous day. The photograph is now in my album from
                  that trip, and serves as a constant reminder of how things can
                  get out of hand if the wrong people have power. I think Dachau
                  should be a mandatory stop for anyone visiting Europe.</i></p>
                  <p align="left"><i>Also, when I was in Munich, I was sitting
                  on a park bench having lunch with my girlfriend. An elderly
                  German man on a bike stopped to rest on the bench. We started
                  talking to him, and he told us stories about WWII. The most
                  vivid memory he shared with us was about when the Jews would
                  be hiding in their basements from the Gestapo. He would often
                  walk around at night and discreetly give bread and water to
                  the Jewish families. Any time that he would venture outside
                  Germany, people would resent his presence, just because he was
                  German.</i></p>
