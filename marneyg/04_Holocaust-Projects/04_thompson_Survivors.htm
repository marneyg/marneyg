      could not do things like be in the streets, teach in&nbsp; public schools,
      have jobs that have anything to do with the government.&nbsp; Jewish
      children had to sit in the last rows of desk in the class room.&nbsp; Soon
      Jews couldn't even be a citizen because of a law that was passed called
      the Nuremberg Racial Laws&nbsp; causing Jews to loose their
      citizenship&nbsp; immedtely.&nbsp; So 100,000 Jews left Germany.&nbsp; But
      even though they didn't want the Jews in their country the Germans made it
      hard for them to leave.&nbsp;also few countries would let the Jews in their
      country </td>

      painted a yellow stripe from their head the the end of their backs.&nbsp;
      The Nazis put numbers on their arms to identify them.&nbsp; Like one
      person's number equaled 18 and in the Hebrew&nbsp; and alphabet 18 was the
      word chai.&nbsp; Witch is life in English language.&nbsp; In the morning
      before they went to work Jews would get a&nbsp; piece of bread.&nbsp; At
      the camp Majanek they gave the Jews striped shirts and pants also wooden
      shoes, but when they went to work they had to take off their shoes and tie
      them around their shoulder with a string.&nbsp; Jews had to work no matter
      what. If the Nazis did not need any of the Jews they shot them the
      Jews.&nbsp; Some of the Nazis called the Jews dogs.&nbsp; If a Jew gets hurt
      and the Nazis know it they hang the Jew that is hurt.&nbsp; The Nazis also
      hang you for any little thing.&nbsp; What ever number went to work the
      same number has to come back from work. When Jews get back from there work
      they get a bowl of soup and the soup is made of water, grass, and sand.
      Jew work for12 hours. At night they sleep on wood.&nbsp; </td>
