      forest in March 1942. It operated from May 1942 till October 1943. There
      were a total of five gas chambers which had killed a total of two hundred
      and fifty thousand Jews. Sobibor was known for the most prisoners
      escaping. Out of all of the victims that tried escaping, sixty actually
      survived, and 260,000 were killed. From May until June 100,000 Jews were
      killed. Gas chambers were the quickest way to kill as many Jews as
      possible. They had came up with a new way to kill besides the systematic
      method. The new way was to push the Jews off a roof and let hang from an
      umbrella to assemble parachuting. Sobibors systematic method was....... a
      train would arrive and victims were told that&nbsp; they have arrived at a
      transit camp that was on the way to the actual camps. The victims were
      told that before they could leave they would have to take showers and
      their clothes would be disinfected. The men and women were separated, and
      ordered to take off all of their cloths and valuables off. They were
      marched to gas chambers (the shower rooms). There could be up to 450-550
      people in the chambers at once. When the chambers were full, the doors
      were shut and sealed - gas was pumped in. To hide the terrified screams of
      victims standing in line for the gas chambers, they had kept geese which
      were let loose when something crucial would happen. The killing in the
      chambers took about 20-30 minutes to kill all of the people. They would be
      removed and buried after the gold teeth were taken off. This whole process
      took 2-3 hours. In the meantime railway cars were cleaned and the
      train&nbsp; departed while another 20 cars entered. The tree branches
      wrapped around the barbed wire fence to disguise the camp. Some of the
      prisoners tried to stab the workers in the backs while bent over to pick
      up branches and the people that tried stabbing the workers got their
      trousers sewed up after rats are thrown inside. Sobibor had different ways
      to kill babies and some of these ways were to throw them in garbage pits
      or torn apart down the middle by the legs.</td>

      September 1941. The killing centers were not yet ready so victims were
      dumped into overcrowded &quot;ghettos&quot; by the camps. By the summer
      of&nbsp; 1942 the chambers were working. The one purpose the camps were
      opened was to kill many Jews as quickly as possible. As they arrived the
      victims went went directly to the gas chambers. The causes of death for
      thousands of inmates in the death camps was from starvation, being worked
      to death, exposure to elements, epidemics, and disease. The first inmates
      were communists, democrats, socialists, political criminals, homosexuals,
      and of course Jews. Extermination in the first few months was by diesel
      fumes called Zyklon-B gas. By August 1942 more than 6,000 people died
      including 2,000 non-Jews. Death camps were the most vicious part of WWII.
      The Final Solution included mass killings of anyone considered sum-human
      by the Nazi Party. This was the beginning of the deaths of 11,000,000
      people, mainly Jews. </td>
