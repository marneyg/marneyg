      wanted to send food to them but the Germans wouldn't let them.&nbsp; They
      would let them send personal parcels to them, so the Red Cross sent food

      summer.&nbsp; During that time they made the Jews clean up the
      ghetto.&nbsp; They started planting flowers, painting, and scraping off
      the old paint. Now this grody ghetto into a cheerful Jewish town.&nbsp;
      The Germans didn't want the town to overcrowd, so they sent the incoming

      of 1943, the Germans provided the Jews with scripts. A group of Jews
      greeted the Red Cross.&nbsp; the committee toured the town passing parks,
      playgrounds and other homey objects.&nbsp; The committee left with a
      pleasing report on the town.&nbsp; The Danish Jews however, were not
      pleased with the report. They were saddened that the Red Cross didn't find
      the real truth. They were happy about the outcome of the Germans fearing
      that the Red Cross might want to come back, so they promised the Danish
      Jews that were there they could stay instead of going to death camps. They
      also improved the living conditions and the food rations to the
      Jews.&nbsp; Upon the liberation in 1945, only 17,320 prisoners of an
      estimated 140,000 remained in camp.&nbsp; All others were sent to death
      camps.&nbsp; Some died from diseases.&nbsp; 400 of the 450 Danish Jews
      sent to the camp in 1943 lived.</td>
