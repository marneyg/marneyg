      Were we going to try to save them?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the answer was,

      when it came to symbols, he had them printed in yellow and blue. He even
      put the coat of arms or the Three Crowns of Sweden in the middle. these
      passes were the ticket between life or death for the Jews. They were known
      as a Scutzpass. He was given 1,500 passports by the Hungarian Foreign

      Already 437,402 woman, men, and children had been deported from Hungary.
      There was still 230,000 left and if he was going to save any, he had to
      hurry! So, he soon started making &quot;Swedish Houses&quot; where Jews
      could seek help. To trick German officers he hung a Swedish flag outside
      in front of each door to declare it Swedish property. There were soon over
      15,000 Jews living in the Swedish houses. Raoul, while setting up Swedish
      houses, a number of times had confrontations with Adolf Eichmann to try to
      persuade him to stop demolishing Jews. Adolf Eichmann was the Nazi
      architect of the &quot;Final Solution.&quot; It didn't matter though
      Eichmann was still going to kill the Jews. Eichmann was even trying to set
      up a 24-hour blitzkrieg to kill the remaining Jews. Raoul was working hard
      to try to prevent that from happening. Soon Miklos Horthy, the leader of
      Hungary, found out about the 24-hour blitzkrieg. Horthy didn't like the
      idea so he temporarily banished Eichmann.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

      looking for him. Jan Larrson, one of his co-workers, urged him to hide or
      seek shelter because he was taking a major risk of getting himself killed.
      Raoul said in reply, &quot;To me there's other choice. I've accepted this
      assignment and I could never return to Stockholm without the knowledge
      that I'd done everything in human power to save as many Jews as
      possible.&quot; So, he decided he needed to explain to the Soviet
      commanders his humanitarian work to them. He decided he needed to go and
      talk to them in Debrecen. Before he went he set up a department for
      surviving Jews in November 1944. He knew that the Soviets probably would
      think that he was a secret agent for America, so he went to Debrecen to
      tell them the truth. He went to Debrecen with a chauffeur named Vilmos
      Langfelder. They were said to be captured by the vicious Soviet Army. The

      remaining in secure, neutral Sweden when Nazism was ruling Europe.
      Instead, he left this haven and went to what was then one of the most
      perilous places in Europe. And for what? To save Jews. He won this battle
      and I feel that in this age when there is so little to believe in is very
      little on which our young people can pin their hopes and ideals-he is a
      person to show the world, which knows so little about him. That is why the
