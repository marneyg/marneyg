      Annelies Marie, other known as Anne Frank, was looked at, by some people,
      as an immature child wanting attention.&nbsp; She never really got to grow
      out of this immaturity.&nbsp; Her childhood was just like any other
      child's.&nbsp; Although this would soon change since&nbsp; she was living
      when the Nazis were coming to power.&nbsp; Anne was a Jewish girl living
      in Germany, where the Nazis were arresting the Jewish people.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      When Anne and her family was captured&nbsp; they were taken to different
      camps, Anne and her sister in one, her dad in another, and her mom
      somewhere else.&nbsp; Anne Frank is famous because she kept a diary and
      wrote things&nbsp; in it about what was happening during the time of the
      Nazis, and the Holocaust.</font></td>

      Anne Frank was born on June 12,1929 in Frankfurt, Germany.&nbsp; She was
      one of those girls really craved for attention.&nbsp; When Anne was little
      she would climb up on the table so everyone could see her and give her the
      attention she craved,&nbsp; especially if there where pretty things on it
      that others were looking at.&nbsp; Anne and her sister Margot loved
      visiting their grandmother, which they did often, so you can tell they had
      a pretty good relationship&nbsp; with their family.&nbsp; Anne loved to
      watch movies with her friends, too.&nbsp; She sometimes made invitations
      for her friends to come and watch movies.&nbsp; On Anne's Thirteenth
      Birthday, which was her last in freedom,&nbsp; she&nbsp; had her friends
      other and they watch Anne's&nbsp; favorite movie, &quot;Rin Tin
      Tin&quot;.&nbsp; There are many photographs of Anne and her family,
      because Anne' s father Otto Frank loved taking them.&nbsp; He took many
      photos of Anne and Margot playing with their friends.</font> </td>

      Once&nbsp; Anne got there,&nbsp; she could barely remember her life in
      Germany,&nbsp; even though she was there for thirteen years.&nbsp; Anne
      quickly felt at home in Amsterdam.&nbsp; In 1940,&nbsp; Germany invaded
      Holland.&nbsp; On July 6, 1942,&nbsp; the day after Margot received a
      &quot;call up&quot; to report to a &quot;labor camp&quot;,&nbsp;&nbsp; the

      Some officers got out of the car and ran in the building.&nbsp; They asked
      a man named van Maaren a question, his answer was
      &quot;Upstairs&quot;.&nbsp; The officers then went up to the next
      floor.&nbsp; One of the officers opened the main office door and found a
      woman named Meip Gies and two others,&nbsp; they were some friends and
      employees of Otto Frank.&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp; the officers then went over
      to a bookcase,&nbsp; it was the door to the Frank's hiding place.&nbsp;
      One of the officers then pulled on the bookcase and it swung open
      revealing the Frank family.&nbsp; The Franks were then arrested and taken

      <p><font color="#FF0000">In everything I do, I can watch myself as if I
      were a stranger. I can stand across from the everyday Anne and, without
      being baised or making excuses, watch what she's doing, both the good and
      the bad.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Anne called her diary Kitty and as she started to
      document her innermost feelings she recorded one of the darkest periods in
      human history, the Holocaust. But no matter what happened Anne never lost
      faith in humanity.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Anne and Margot wrote many sisterly letters to
      each other, Anne wrote some of these in her diary, here is one set of
      them:</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">&quot;Dear Anne,</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">After your letter yesterday I have the unpleasant
      feeling that you will have prickings of conscience when you visit Peter;
      but really there is no reason for this. In my heart of hearts I feel that
      I have the right to share mutual confidence with someone, but I could not
      bear Peter in that role yet.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Therefore you really needn't pity me. Now that
      you've found companionship, enjoy it as much as you can.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">&quot;Dear Margot,</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">I think the best thing we can do is simply to
      wait and see what happens. It can't be very long before Peter and I come
      to a definite decision, either to go on as before to be different. Just
      which way to go I don't know myself, and I don't bother to look beyond my
      own nose. But I shall certainly do one thing, if Peter and I decide to be
      friends, I shall tell him that you are very fond of him too and would
      always be prepared to help him should the need arise. The latter may not
      be what you wish, but I don't care now; I don't know what peter thinks
      about you, but I shall ask him then. I'm sure it's not bad- the opposite!
      You are always welcome to join us in the attic, or wherever we are; you
      honestly won't disturb us because I feel we have a silent agreement to
      talk only in the evening when its dark. Keep your courage up! Like I do.
      Although it's not always easy, your time may come sooner than you
      think.&quot;&nbsp;</font></td>

      Anne's father survived war. When he met up again with Meip Gies she gave
      him Anne's diary and said he should get it published. Anne's diary was
      published in1947, in almost seventy languages. This is the story of Anne
      Frank, or some of it. Anne was a very brave girl her whole life. Over one
      MILLION children died in the Holocaust. Anne was one of them.</font></td>
