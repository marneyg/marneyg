      party. On September 2, in regular civilian clothes, Hitler went to spy on
      the small German Workers Party. When Hitler arrived, there was about
      twenty-five other people there also. Hitler then listened to a speech on
      economics by one of the party's leaders, Gottfried Feder. After
      Gottfried's
      speech a man in the crowd stood up and started speaking in favor of the
      German State of Bavaria which Hitler strongly apposed. Hitler was enraged
      and even though he was there as a spy he stood up and spoke aloud against
      the man. When the leaders from the party heard Hitler's speech, they were
      shocked. After his speech, the leaders rushed over to Hitler and asked if
      he would become part of their party. A day later Hitler became the seventh
      member of the German Workers Party.</b></td>

      the government. Hitler also gave many speeches after he became part of the
      group. At a rented beer cellar that could hold a hundred people, Hitler
      gave a speech and the crowd went wild with excitement. On February
      24,1920, Hitler entered a hall in Munich and began a speech but was rudely
      interrupted by a jealous party of Communists who started booing and
      yelling at him. They were soon drowned out by the applause of all of the
      followers of the German Workers Party,and they soon left. By the end of the

      of the Nazi Party. So when Hitler was over in Berlin trying to get support
      they formed an alliance against Hitler to try and weaken his position in
      the party. When Hitler came back to Munich and found out what they were
      trying to do to him, he resigned and the Party then realized how much they
      needed him and how much they would lose, like all of his followers, and
      all of his great outstanding speeches that attracted all of those
      thousands of people. So the leaders asked Hitler to rejoin the Party and
      Hitler agreed under one condition - that he could have total and complete
      control over the party. At first some of the leaders resisted, but they
      soon gave in. After that, the Nazi Party grew from 27,000 members in 1925
      to 178,000 by 1929.</b></td>

      five years in prison and the other Nazi leaders were given light
