      that a Jewish family was being forced to move.&nbsp; Their daughter, Berta
      Grynszpan, wrote a letter to her brother, Herschel Grynszpan, saying they
      had been forced to move and they were penniless.&nbsp; Hearing this
      Herschel became enraged.&nbsp; The next day he came to Germany and when he
      got there he bought himself a gun.&nbsp; This day was November 7, 1983, he
      entered the German Embassy and shot Ernst vom Rath a minor official.&nbsp;
      Two days later vom Rath died.&nbsp; that night, November 9, 1938, Minister
      of Propaganda&nbsp; Joseph Goebbels&nbsp; and the Nazi's broke into
      synagogues and burnt them to ash, killed and arrested Jews, and destroyed
      shops.&nbsp; This was only the beginning.</td>

      Kristallnacht.&nbsp; He is telling what he remembers from his childhood on
      the night of Kristallnacht.&nbsp; From his apartment window in
      Ludwigshafen, Germany, 65 years ago, Richard Weilheimer gazed down onto a
      horrifying scene.&nbsp; People were being beaten and arrested.&nbsp; They
      had taken his father away already.&nbsp; When it was their turn they were
      very frightened.&nbsp; His mother took his brothers and sisters and him
      for a walk.&nbsp; &quot;It was humanity gone berserk,&quot; said
      Weilheimer.&nbsp; They went back to their home to find dishes destroyed,
      clothes and linens had been piled in the center of their living room and
      ink and molasses had been pored all over them.&nbsp; &quot;I will never
      forget the smell of it,&quot; he said.&nbsp; Fred M. Margulies, now 76,
      remembers and tells what happened to him on Kristallnacht.&nbsp; He was
      only eleven at this time.&nbsp; &quot;It brings back painful
      memories,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;It fueled the fate for us that life
      for Jews was over.&quot;&nbsp; He remembers his mother showing up at his
      school.&nbsp; His father had been arrested two weeks earlier.&nbsp; His
      mother devised a plan for a place to meet in emergency.&nbsp; This was the
      entrance of a luggage store.&nbsp; While waiting for his sister there he
      saw Torah-Scrolls burning.&nbsp; He began to cry.&nbsp; &quot;I kept
      asking my mother if God had died,&quot; she said &quot;What you see today
      you must never forget for the rest of your life; I cannot forget this and
      I will never forget this.&quot;&nbsp; Margulies was the only survivor from
      his family.&nbsp; His mother Rosa, his father Wolf, and his twelve year
      old sister Thea.&nbsp; Weilheimer lost both of his parents Max and
      Lilly.&nbsp; Steven Ross is another survivor from Kristallnacht.&nbsp;
      &quot;I cherish America, and I kiss the ground that I walk on,&quot; he
      said &quot;I never forget those men that saved me.&quot;&nbsp; Ross had
      been sent to ten different Nazi labor camps over a span of five
      years.&nbsp; He showed items from the camps such as; a hat a part of their
      uniform, a dish they used to eat off of, and a pair of shoes.&nbsp; Also
      he showed figures made from crushed bones from Jews.&nbsp; &quot;You knew
      you were going to die, but you didn't want to.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;The only
      thing that kept&nbsp; us alive was our religion.&quot;</td>

      1938.&nbsp; 30,000 Jews were arrested and at least 91 killed on the
      spot.&nbsp; Those who were arrested were sent to functioning concentration
      camps as in, Buchenwald, Dachau, and Sachsenhausen.&nbsp; The murder of
      six million Jews, twenty-thousand Gypsies, seventy-thousand handicapped
      and mental patients, and ten-thousand homosexuals were all murdered.&nbsp;
      Kristallnacht means The Night of Broken Glass.&nbsp; It got its name from
      all of the shattered glass from synagogues but mainly shop windows.&nbsp;
      They were shattered all over the streets and floors of shops.&nbsp; All of
      the Jews that were left were forced to clean this mess up out of streets
      and shops they were made to do this for humiliation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      This separated Jews from others.&nbsp; They were painted on the windows or
      doors of their shops.&nbsp; Also a German guard would stand outside a shop
      to show it was owned by Jews.&nbsp; Jews were made to wear the Star of
      David as a patch on either an armband or on their clothing.&nbsp; This
      star is unlike our regular five point star.&nbsp; It has six points and an
      open center.&nbsp; If they didn't wear the patch they wore dog tags and
      carried a pocket book marked with a &quot;Z&quot; meaning Zsido or
      Jew.&nbsp; The Star of David was &quot;a mark of shame.&quot;</td>
