      Schickgurber married his first wife, Anna Glassl, having no children. Then
      in 1876 Alois changed his name from Schicklgruber to Hitler. Alois and
      Anna filed for divorce because Alois was having an affair with Franzika
      Matzelgerger in 1880. In 1883 Alois' first wife died while he married
      Franziska Matzelgerger in the same year. Just one year after they married,

      were his parents. Many people said Alois abused Klara and Adolf. Adolf was
      born in Braunau, Austria. Adolf had a very troubled childhood. He did very
      poorly in school. He attended school in 1895 for four years&nbsp; but then
      went to secondary school at age eleven. He wanted to be an artist but
      Alois wanted him to be a government official. Adolf lost interest in
      school and dropped out at age six-teen. In 1905, Adolf went to live with
      his Klara and became good friends with August and Gustl Kulizek.&nbsp;
      Both Gustl and Adolf left for Vienna in 1908. While Adolf was in Vienna he
      learned of his hatred of the Jewish people, then becoming Anti-Semitic. To
      get away from a mixture of races and escape serving in the military with
      Jews, Adolf moved to Munich, Germany at age twenty-four. In the war
      Germany lost to Great Britain and the United States in 1918, Adolf&nbsp;
      was wounded twice and awarded the Iron Cross.&nbsp;</b></td>

      who should have to pay for Germany's loss in the war. After the war Adolf
      went poor and began looking for a job in politics. He got a job spying on
      political parties. One of his assignments was to spy on Anton Drexler,
      Gottfried Feder, and Dietrich Eckart, who formed the German Workers Party.
      While Adolf was spying on them he realized they had many of the same out
      looks on things as he. Shortly after he got an invitation to join and
      became the leader or Fuher in 1921. He then made it the largest political

      in jail for attempts to over throw the German Government. A sentence of
      five years but somehow only served nine months. While Adolf was in jail he
      wrote his plans to take over Germany entitled &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; (My
      Struggle). Yet again when Adolf got out of jail he planned another
      revolt&nbsp; in Munich to make himself dictator. He revolted at a good
      time for Germany was in a deep depression. Businesses were closing,
      people&nbsp; were losing their jobs, and Adolf promised he could get all
      of them back on their feet. When Adolf and the Nazis did get to power,
      they started persecuting Jews, Gypsies, Homosexuals, and the mentally challenged.

      concentration camps such as Auschwitz, Dachu, or Treblinka.&nbsp;</b></td>

      eyes and then stabbed hi to death before his mother. They were sent to
      jail and Adolf sent them letter saying &quot;I will do everything in my
      power to get you both out&quot;. Jews were robbed of everything. Adolf
      secretly was creating a mass army, far larger than the Treaty of Versailles
      allowed them to have. Adolf set an alliance with Italy and a deal that
      would keep Russia out of any way that involved Germany. That deal was set
      so Adolf took Poland and split the land with Stalin. Adolf planned an
      attack on Poland on August 26, 1939 at 4:30 p.m. But on August 25, Britain
      and Poland signed a pact on mutual assistance so he had to deal with that
      first. Adolf thought it was vital to set an alliance with Britain and
      Italy so they weren't fighting wars in the East and West at the same time.
      However, Mussolini&nbsp; said if he attacked Poland, Italy would not join
      them. So he was forced to post-pone his attack until September 1, 1939 at
      4:45 a.m. Another mass murdering of Jews was Kristallnach (night of long
      knives) under Adolf's command. On Sepetember 1, Adolf sent U-30 subs to
      attack the British liner, Athena. That attack killed 1,400 passengers, 120
      of which were Americans. So world War Two began. In the spring of 1940,
      Adolf conqured Demnark, Norway, The Netherlands, and France. He began to
      threatin Austria and convinced Herr Schuschnigg to sign Austria over to
      German control. Followed by&nbsp; taking Belgum and Holland for Naval and
      Air wellfare. Adolf then relized all this time the Allies were moving
      closer and closer until they almost had him backed in to a corner. Many of
      him commanders and generals told him that it was over for them. Adolf
      panicked and shot himself in the mouth with him new wife, Eva Braun, at
      his side. She poisoned herself. Their bodies were found April 30, at
      2:30p.m. Their bodies were taken then burned.</b></td>
