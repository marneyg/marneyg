    <td width="100%" colspan="2">Anne Frank was a Jewish diarist, who was known for the
      diary she wrote during the hiding from the anti-Jewish persecution in Amsterdam.
      during World War II (1939-1945). Anne's diary describes with wisdom and humor
      the two long&nbsp; she spent in seclusion, before the death at the age of
      15.&nbsp; This story is about Annelies Marie Frank from the time she was
      born until the age of 15.</td>

    <td width="100%" colspan="2">Annelies Marie Frank was born June 12, 1929, in Frankfort
      am Main, Germany. they left there in 1933 to escape the anti-Jewish
      measures of National Socialism, also called Nazism. her father, Otto, took
      the family to Amsterdam where he owned a food business . on Anne's 13th
      birthday she got a diary, she began writing down her thoughts and
      experiences in the form of a letter to an imaginary friend. A month later
      the family went into hiding. Germany invaded the Netherlands in 1940. then
      the franks once again were a subject to the anti-Semitic Persecution. in
      1941 Anne was forced to go to a Jewish&nbsp;school. Secretly, Otto Frank
      prepared a hiding place by blocking off several rooms in the back of&nbsp;his
      building. The rooms Otto made were hidden by a swinging bookcase. during
      the course of the twenty-five months she wrote down all her thoughts and experiences
      while she was hiding. her diary tells about her life times during the
      years in hiding.&nbsp; </td>

      Frank and Eva Gardner quickly became very good friends after the first
      meeting in Amsterdam on February 1940. there was one other thing that the
      two 11-year olds had in common-one that the German SS were concerned. THEY

      invaded Holland were hell-bent on rounding up all the Jewish families and&nbsp;
      sending them off to the gas chambers. The parents and both the girls knew
      they had to go into hiding.'' I suddenly became aware that friends weren't
      acting like friends anymore &quot; she recalls&quot; And even on the
      playground at school, people I thought were friends of mine suddenly didn't
      want to play with me any more.&quot; the sheerer horror of Auschwitz meant
      that, for many years Eva spoke about her own experiences very seldom. That
      way, she felt&nbsp; she had a chance of keeping the terrible memories at
      bay. A role which finds her in Edinburgh today. Where she has the chance
      to recount her experiences to secondary school students from across the
      city. although &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both remarkably
      managed to leave the&nbsp;Polish camp alive, Anne was later to die at
      another camp. The story of course become known the world over, thanks to
      her diaries she wrote during hiding. there they lived with the knowledge
      that they were next for the gas chambers. both of the girls had to survive
      a diet of moldy bread, suffer beatings by the guards, fend off the freezing
      in the barest of clothing, endure humiliating delousing, watch the rampant
      spread of disease..... and worst of all, see friends die in front of them
      every single day despite the feeling able to talk about her experiences
      now, Eva Schloss, as she became, admits that the horror will never fully
      go away. &quot;Its been more than55 years ago now but I can still clearly
      remember things. What we experienced was just too awful to ever to be able
      to forget. I remember she was a lively girl, but we were both part of a larger
      group of friends who used to get to together all the time,&quot; Eva
      recalls now. &quot;I used to see her every day. My difficulty, though ,
      was knowing the Dutch language.&quot; I couldn't really under stand what
      the reasons were, I just found&nbsp; it all completely strange and very
      hurtful. I wasn't only a child and it upset me allot. Before Eva began
      working with Anne Frank Educational Trust, where she gained the chance to
      promote the anti-Jewish message to the young people of today. Eva is also
      here to see the Anne Frank Exhibition at Edinburgh's City Art Center in
      Market Street. And with Holocaust Memorial Day taking place later this
      moth Eva who ended up becoming Anne Franks posthumous step-sister when
      Anne's father married Eva's father Eva's mother hopes and prays that the
      message is hitting home. &quot;For years I had this recurring nightmare
      when I would wake up sweating and trembling, the far from frail &quot;
      grandmother says. &quot;But the time has helped. And I know it's a very
      important story to tell&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
