      care, like extra food and clothing and he allowed them to keep their hair.
      He would even give them candy when they were corporative. Despite the fact that some

      them onto the wall in his office. He would also take blood samples from
      one twin then put the sample in the other twin. This mostly caused headaches
      and high fevers for several days. Mengele placed patients in isolation
      cages and subjected them to a variety of stimuli just to see their
      reactions. He would inject twins with infectious agents to watch how long
      it takes to succumb to various diseases. He removed victims limbs in
      surgical procedures with out any anesthetic. Mengele also castrated and
      sterilized almost all of the twins. After Mengele collected all the data
      he wanted from a patient, they were killed by a single injection of
      chloroform in the heart. He would take special care to make sure that twins
      were killed at the same time. Then they were dissected and their organs
      were taken to research centers.</td>

      Hungarian twins. He had their whole body closely measured and x-rayed and
      had them be photographed in several different positions including standing
      with their arms up in order to photograph their underarm hair. He then had
      tubes forced down their noses and into their lungs and then they were

      tried. Out of the 24, eight were acquitted, fifteen found guilty, seven
      were sentenced to death, and eight were imprisoned. Mengele was not among
      these 24, he had escaped to South America, before Auschwitz was found by
      the Allies, and died there in a drowning accident in 1979. The Trials
      began in the October of 1946 and lasted until the August of 1947.</td>

      meaning. The truth is they all were stupid and had no meaning. The Germans
      conducted these experiments to find a way to make a &quot;superior
      race&quot; of Aryan Germans. It didn't happen, all it did was cause pain
      to millions of innocent people of all ages. We can't change what has happened. All we can do is make sure it never happens again. What these
      doctors did was wrong and against everything being a doctor is about. They
      ended lives when they were supposed to save them. What made these people
      do this no one knows;&nbsp; maybe they thought they were helping in the
      long run. All we know is that they didn't.</td>
