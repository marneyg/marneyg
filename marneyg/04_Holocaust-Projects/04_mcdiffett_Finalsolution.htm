      first Jews were deported as &quot;undesirable-aliens&quot; or sent to
      internment camps in 1938. Then later they were taken to Auschwitz. The
      first Jews that got to Auschwitz were gassed in a reconstructed farm house
      on March 26,1942. Most of the Jews were killed by gas chambers or by open
      gun fire. Every where the Jews went they would be captured and killed or
      just shot there. It was decided that later the Jews would be allocated for
      appropriate labor in the East. With the German invasion of Poland in
      September 1939 a further million and a half&nbsp; Jews came under German
      rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; 11 million Jews would be involved in the &quot;Final
      Solution of the European Jewish Question&quot;.&nbsp; 1.5 million of that

      because they killed most of the Jews. During the course of fifteen months,
      two million Jews were murdered in four different concentration camps. At
      Auschwitz during the Final Solution 1.5 million Jews were killed, and at
      Treblinka 870,000. The ghettos were also important in the killing of the
      Jews. The ghettos&nbsp; ,later concentration camps, where Nazis would
      concentrate Jewish populations in order to start their extermination. The
      Warsaw ghetto got forced out of during the final liquidation by the SS.
      The Jews from the Warsaw ghetto got sent to Treblinka. By April 1941
      ghettos had been enforced throughout German-occupied Poland. By June the
      death toll from starvation had reached 2,000 a month in the Warsaw ghetto
      and 800 a month in the Lo'dz ghetto.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

      Heinrich Himmler was one of them. Himmler was the one who planned the
      slaughter of three-quarters of all European Jews. The term genocide was
      coined by Adolf Eichmann. Joseph Goebbel's dairies were important in the
      understanding of Adolf Hitler's plan to establish a superior &quot;Aryan
      Race&quot;. Which would mean for him to have to kill the Jews of the Holocaust.
      Since the moment Hitler decided to become a dictator, the Final Solution
      was already in his mind. &quot;Once I really am in power, my first and
      foremost task will be the annihilation of the Jews&quot; ,said Hitler
      before he became a dictator. He later achieved his goal killing six
      million Jews. The decision to start the Final Solution was made by Adolf
      Hitler at the end of 1941. The Nazis were also a big factor. The Nazis
      called all Jews &quot;race-enemies&quot;. The worst consequence of the
      racist policy was the mass murder genocide. The Nazis would trap the Jews
      in Ghettos then take them to the death camps. The Final Solution was used
      as a code for the deportation of all Jews. </td>
