      Hitler was born at half past six on April 20th 1889.Son of Alois Hitler
      and Karla Hitler. Adolf did not have a good relationship with his father
      and it ended with his death in 1903,when Adolf was 13. Later his mother
      let him drop out of school, and he celebrated by getting drunk he promised
      to himself he would never get drunk again. he didn't and by the time he
      was thirty he gave up drinking totally. then Hitler moved to Vienna to
      become an art student which he was denied of. His mother died in December
      1909 of cancer he was a whole lot sadder than when his father died people have
      said that he carried he picture with him every where, some say it was in
      his hands when he died.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

                        officers and replaced them with Nazi supporter's the
                        (Gestapo). By 1934 he had all the power's of state under
                        his control. In 1937 unemployment went from 6 million to
                        1 million. Hitler tried to make life so unpleasant that
                        they would emigrate to a different country. So Jews
                        couldn't go into certain places like restaurants, colleges,
                        and they couldn't marry out of there race. A lot of them
                        left the country. On the 9-10th of November 1938 Crystal
                        night or Kristallnacht began Jewish stores and Synagogues
                        were burned. Polish Jews were dropped of at Poland borders. After
                        this many Jews left the country. after being in power he
                        broke part of the Treaty of Versailles by forming an
                        army, and sending troops into
                        Rhineland. He took over Austria then he took over Poland
                        then he shared land with the Soviet Union. Then
                        Operation Barbarossa or taking over or invading the
                        Soviet Union. The rain and snow slowed them down. Then
                        the final solution began or deporting &nbsp;of the Jews
                        or rounding up the Jews in the Soviet Union. After this
                        Extermination camps could kill more people a day. On
                        December 11 Hitler declared war on the United States.
                        And a lot of different Countries joined the war. By February
