      neighborhoods in Riga, the Maskavos Suburb.&nbsp; 19% of the Jews already
      lived there. That was 9,805 Jews. On October 1941 a fence was put up
      around the Ghetto. It eventually became a double barb wire fence. If you
      went near it you were shot onsite. The Jews weren't allowed to bring
      anything into the Ghetto except personal items, cloths, and simple
      household furniture. There was a hospital in the Ghetto with very scarce
      medical supplies. There were also schools and soup kitchens. Jews had to
      find their own home in the Ghetto. That meant sharing a home with other
      families. The suburb was originally designed for 13,000 people, but the
      Germans put 29,602 Jews in the Ghetto. On November 27,1941 the Jews were
      told that they would be shifted further east. They didn't know that they
      were going to the Rumbuli Forest, where 15,000 of them were going to be
      shot. After that took place, a smaller Ghetto was established for younger
      men. On December 8,1941 the same horror was repeated. 10,000 deaths took
      place in the forest. The mission to kill all of the Latvian Jews, with
      some exceptions, had been completed.&nbsp;</td>

      were bound to stay for your execution.&quot; said Yala Korwin. Jews were
      forced to do heavy labor. They had to dig without shovels. The Jews were
      given 300 grams of bread once a day. They were also given a dark watery
      substance that the Germans called soup. On November 7,1941 a major pogrom
      took place. 13,000 Jews were taken into Tuchink and brutally killed.
      Another massacre took place on November 20,1941, in Minsk. 7,000 Jews were
      killed that day. At the end of March 1942 a new wave of pogroms began.
      They occurred on March 31,1942 and April 3,1942. By October 1,1943, 2,000
      Jews remained in the Ghetto. On October 21,1943, the Gestapo surrounded
      the Ghetto again. All of the remaining Jews were loaded into trucks and
      taken away. Buildings were blown up in case someone was hiding in them.
      Only the ruins would bare witness to the horrible and inhuman crimes
      committed to tens of thousands of Jews of the Minsk Ghetto.</td>

    <td width="100%">The Nazis mapped out a Ghetto in Czernowitz, and ordered
      50,000 Jews to move into it within the next eight hours. Traian Popovicz,
      the Mayor of the city, recorded what happened. &quot;I look outside the
      window of my bedroom and amidst the flying flakes of the early snow I saw
      a scene which was incredible. In the streets was a vast crowd of wandering
      people. The aged were helped by children, there were women with infants in
      their arms, cripples dragging their lame frame. All had bundles in their
      hands or were pushing small carriages loaded with boxes. Some carried
      their burden on their backs: luggage, bundles of linen, cushions, blankets,
      clothing, rags. They were beginning their mute pilgrimage to their bale of
      tears, the Ghetto. Only one who knows the topography of Czernowitz can
      grasp how inadequate was the space reserved for the Ghetto... This section
      that could hardly have accumulated 10,000 people had to house 50,000 Jews
      plus the Christian population which lived there... many were forced to
      live in corridors, cellars, garages, under bridges, anywhere to find
      shelter against snow and rain. Of the hygienic conditions I don't even
      speak. Now sanitary water to drink... the pungent smell of sweat, urine,
      and excrement, of loathsome humidity... exactly like the smell of a flock
      of sheep in the field&quot; Ludwik Hirszfel asked a little girl &quot;What
      would&nbsp; you like to be?&quot; &quot;A dog,&quot; she answered
      &quot;because the Sentries like dogs.&quot; The reason most Jews were
      starved is because it was cheaper than shooting them. W. Szpiliman saw something
      terrible in the Ghetto one day, as he was walking along the inside wall,
      he described it. &quot;I came across a smuggling&nbsp; operation being
      carried out by children. The actual operation seemed to be over. There was
      only one thing to do. The little Jewish boy on the other side of the wall
      had to slip back into the Ghetto through the hole, bringing with him the last
      piece of booty. Half of the little boy was already visible, when he began
      to cry out. At the same time loud abuse in German could be heard from the
      &quot;Aryan&quot; side. I hurried to help the child, meaning to pull
      quickly the hole. Unhappily, the boys' hips stuck fast in the gap of the
      wall. Using both hands, I tried with all my might to pull him through. He
      continued to scream dreadfully. I could hear the police on the other side
      beating him savagely. When I successfully succeeded in pulling the boy
      through the hole, he was already dying. His back bone was was crushed.&quot;</td>

      they confined almost 400,000 Jews in a 3.5 sq. mile space in Warsaw which
      normally housed 160,000 people. The area was surrounded by a 10 ft. wall,
      and was sealed off on November 15,1940. They couldn't leave or they would
      be shot. The Jews were given one bowl of soup a day. Around 300 to 400
      people died each day of starvation and disease. The Germans wanted to kill all of
      the Jews so, to get rid of them all, they burned down&nbsp; the entire
      Ghetto. A report filed by Stoop described the scene. &quot;The Jews stayed
      in burning building until, because of the fear of being burned alive, they
      jumped from upper stories... With their bones broken they still tried to
      crawl across the street into buildings which had not yet been set on
      fire... Despite the danger of being burned alive the Jews and bandits
      often preferred to return into the flames rather than risk being caught by
      us.&quot; The burnings and German attacks continued, but the Jews in
      Warsaw resisted for a total of twenty-eight days. </td>

    <td width="100%">Theresienstadt had been remembered for it's culture, it's
      famous prisoners, and it's visitor from the Red Cross officials. It was
      really a concentration camp holding nearly 60,000 Jews. The area was originally
      designed for 7,000 people. A lot of elderly thought that they were going
      to a resort or spa. Some even paid large sums of money for a nice location
      within their new home. When they arrived they were put in the same small
      house, if not smaller, as everyone else. The houses contained triple-tiered&nbsp;
      bunk beds. Every available&nbsp; floor space was used. Bye August 1942 the
      allotted space per person was two square yards- included usage needed for
      lavatory, kitchen, and storage space. The living/sleeping area was covered
      with vermin like rats, flies, and lice. Nobert Troller
      wrote about his experiences; &quot;Coming back from such surveys (of the
      house) our calves were bitten and full of fleas that we could only remove
      with kerosene.&quot; The housing was separated by gender. Women and
      children under 12 were separated from men and boys over 12. The reason why
      it was called the &quot;Model&quot; Ghetto is: The Danish Red Cross was suppose
      to visit the Ghetto. They were going to make sure that the Jews were
      living in humane conditions. The Germans planned the exact route that the
      Red Cross would take. All of the buildings and ground would be enhanced by
      green turf, flowers, and benches. A playground, sports field, and a monument
      were also added. Prominent and Dutch Jews had their billets enlarge, as
      well had furniture, draped, and flower boxes were added. The commander of
      Theresienstadt, SS Colonel Karl Rahm, ordered 7,500 inhabitants to be
      deported. They decided that the orphans and most of the sick should stay
      and be included in the facade that they were making. They put two signs
      over a building that read &quot;Boys school&quot; and &quot;Closed during
      holidays.&quot; On June 23,1944 the commission arrived. Well rehearsed
      actions took place as the tour commenced. A load of fresh vegetables were
      being delivered, bakers were baking bread, and workers singing were all
      queued by messengers who ran ahead of the tour. After the visit, the Nazis
      were so impressed with what they did that they decided to make a film.</td>
