    <td width="971">Oskar saved hi first &quot;Schindler Jews&quot; in 1939. He
      came to Krakow during the German invasion. He took over a Jewish owned
      company and began to produce
      <p>&nbsp;enamel kitchenware. In his search for power, he opened a factory
      outside the ghetto. He hired Jewish workers, saving them from being sent
      to concentration</p>
      <p>&nbsp;camps. In 1942, Oskar heard his worker saying in Krakow, Jews
      were being sent to Plazow, one of the most brutal concentration camps.
      Oskar persuaded the</p>
      <p>SS and the Armaments Administration to make his factory part of&nbsp;
      Plazow. He hired those even those unfit for work and saved 900 Jews. In
      his factory, no one</p>
      <p>could enter without permission from Oskar himself. He spent every night
      in his office in case the Gestapo came. He also registered the elderly as
      20 years younger</p>
      <p>than they really were and children were registered as adults. Artists,
      docters, and lawyers were registered as mechanics and steel workers, just
      so they could stay</p>
      <p>&nbsp;alive. One of his workers, Eva Scheuer, said,&quot; He took sides
      with the underdog. When someone was in trouble he tried to help.&quot;
      Another one of his workers, </p>
      <p>Zev Kadem, said, &quot;If he was a righteous, honest guy, no one in a
      corrupt, greedy system like the SS would accept him. Schindler used the
      corrupt ways, creativity </p>
      <p>, and inginuity against the monster machine dedicated to death.&quot;
      He also said, &quot;It's not enough to be good. One has to act against
      evil.&quot; Schindler cared very much </p>
      <p>for his Jewish workers.He spent every pfennig he had, even his wife
      Emilie's jewels were sold, to buy cloths, medicine, and food for his
      workers. To get more </p>
      <p>workers, he used bribes like money and illegal black market goods. In
      October 1944, Oskar was told to relocate his factory to Brunnlitz,
      Czechoslovakia and </p>
      <p>was changed to an armaments factory. He hired 800 men from Gross-Rossen
      and 300 women from Auschwitz saving a total of 1,100 Jews. The 300 women </p>
      <p>from Auschwitz were the only ones to make it out of Auschwitz during
      the war. Later in the war, Oskar was recruited to get information on
      Poland by the German </p>
      <p>Intelligance Agency and did a good job doing so. This helped later when
      he needed contacts and to help protect his Jews. In January 1945, Oskar
      and Emilie </p>
      <p>saved 107 of 120 Jewish men (13 had frozen to death in a cattle car
      with no food or water.) Oskar persuaded the commandant at Brunnlitz that
      he needed the </p>
      <p>prisoners for work. The 107 men had been badly frostbitten and
      emaciated. He nursed them back to health and never made them work. As the
      war was coming </p>
      <p>to an end, Oskar prepared duffle bags for his workers. the bags
      contained items so the Jews could start new lives. One bag contained a
      blanket,&nbsp; sewing </p>
      <p>equiptment, and a bottle of vodka among other items. Some used the
      blankets to make clothes and traded the vodka for food. On May, 1945, the
      Russians took </p>
      <p>Brunnlitz. Schindler said he was free and he was a fugitive and the
      Jews shouldn't seek revenge. </p>

    <td width="971">Schindler said he changed after the war because of the
      horrific &quot;Final Soulution&quot;. He said, &quot;I hated the
      brutality, the sadism, and th insanity of Nazism. I just 
      <p>couldn't stand by and see people get destroyed. I did what I could,
      what I had to do, what my coscience told me I must do. Thats all there is
      to it. Really, nothing </p>
      <p>more.&quot; After the war, Oskar's life was dependant on gifts and
      money from his old workers. oskar was hated very much in Germany. He had
      rocks thrown at him,</p>
      <p>he was persecuted, and was called names like &quot;Jew kisser&quot;. He
      had his German citizenship taken away. Since he was a former Nazi, he
      couldn't go to the U.S.
      <p>So,in 1949, Oskar and Emilie moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina and
      started a farm, which later went bankrupt. In 1957, Oskar returned to
      Europe, while Emilie<p>stayed in Argentina. They never saw eachother
      again. On July 18, 1967, Yad Vashem recognized Oskar as &quot;Fighteous
      Among the Nations&quot;. On October 9, <p>1974, Oskar died in Frankfurt,
      Germany of liver failure. A list of his Jewish employees was found in a
      suitcase in 1999.
