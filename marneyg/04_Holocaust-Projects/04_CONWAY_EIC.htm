      Adolf was teased and called &quot;The little Jewish boy&quot; because of
      his dark hair and completion. He wasn't a bad student, just average. At
      eight years old his mother died. His father soon re married and Adolf soon
      had four brothers and one sister. At the age of ten he and his father

      interest in engineering and dropped out of school at the age of seventeen.
      He then became an employee for the Solcony Vacuum Company. After that he
      worked at the American Oil Company, This gave him the opportunity to
      travel. Later he was laid off. this is when he went to Ernst Kaltenbrunner
      for help. Dr. Kaltenbrunner invited him and his father to a meeting for
      the Nazi Party. Kaltenbrunner then managed to get Adolf accepted to a S.S Brigade.
      Eichmann spent some of his time in an S.S. Dachau training camp . After
      spending time in Dachau he was then invited to the S.D.'s the S.S. Sercurity
      Service . He was moved to a Berlin Branch for the S.D. . He worked in
      the section that monitored Freemason before he was moved to the head of
      the Jewish Section in the S.D. . He was then assigned the head of the
      Jewish Department of the S.D. . Eichmann claimed to have joined the S.S.
      by accident . Von Mildenstein (Adolf 's mentor) advised Eichmann to study
      the Jewish Community and History so it would be better to understand the
      Jewish enemy. From there he studied jewish ways and Jewish places . In 1936
      Adolf married Vera Liebel a native Bohemia. They lived in praugue and
      became parent to four boys . On October 1939 Eichmann was appointed to IV

      organization. He did this so he had leaders who allowed Zionist organizations to
      operate . Auschwitz, a death camp Eichmann was well
      interested in, and visited many times. Hoss and Eichmann approved of
      Zyklon B. Together they picked out a sight best for the gassings. Eichmann
      took great pried in the part he played of killing 6 million Jews.</font>

contacted Isser Harel. Isser Harel then put together a team to capture of
Eichmann. This group was called the Mossad team. In all there were thirty people
in this group. Isser Harel was head of this team. Harel himself wanted very
much to capture Eichmann. Harel and the Mossad worked every detail to carry out
this mission . In 1959 the Israelis discovered that Adolf Eichmann changed his
name to Ricardo Klement. One of Eichmanns sons had accidentally left a trail by
using the family name out in the open. The mossad team had then followed the
trail that was left. This trail had lead the team to Garibaldi street in san
Ferrando. From then on his house was under complete surveillance. They still did
not have enough information or proof to certainly say that it was Adolf Eichmann
for sure.<o:p>

The Mossad team was ready to complete there task. They knew Eichmann arrived from
work at 7:40 every day. From a distance two cars sat and waited for Eichmann to arrive
home. But when 7:40 had come around Eichmann was no where to be seen. Four
days later Eichmann came home. One of the Mossad members pounced on him as he
was going inside. The capture had only taken a tops of ten minutes. After staying
in a safe house for a week they where ready to sneak him out of the country. The
team drugged Eichmann and dressed him in a El-Al uniform and boarded him on a
plane. Eichmann looked terribly sick from the drugs even half awake but the
passengers had not asked questions to as why he had looked this way. After
people had found out that Adolf Eichmann was on the plane many had become
uncomfortable and disturbed. <o:p>

trial there where many Jews here to witness this. Eichmann tried to convince
every one that he was just &quot;under orders&quot; or just &quot;a cog in a
machine&quot;. The judges and Jews simply did not care. He had described a scene
he had witnessed at one of the death camps he had visited &quot; the evacuation ditch
had had been covered over with dirt, but blood was gushing out of the
ground like a geyser.&quot; Adolf had later commented that he had no idea to what

with 15 counts . Some where crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes
against Jewish people.<o:p>
