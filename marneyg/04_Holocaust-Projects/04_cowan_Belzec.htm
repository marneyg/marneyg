      Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      1942 to November 1943. The commander of Operation Reinhard was Globocnik,
      Christian Wirth, and the SS men helped them out. Belzec, Sobibor, and
      Treblinka were relatively small and compact. The killing system was
      developed by Christian Wirth. It enabled&nbsp; tens of thousands of Jews
      murdered everyday in three death camp under his jurisdiction. Almost all
      of the victims were sent to the gas chambers believing that they were
      baths. The Jews that were selected for work at the camps and who were
      aware of what was going on didn't give up. A few prisoners in Sobibor and
      Treblinka succeeded in caring out individual escapes and in staging an
      uprise and including an escape. The uprising ensured the secrets of the
      death camps to the world. The perpetrators did not succeed in their

      World War 2. Operations of Treblinka were ready to start in July, 1942.
      Treblinka was under the command of Franz Stangl. The killing process of
      Treblinka was very similar to the killings of Belzec and Sobibor. Between
      July 1942 to September 1942, 300,000 Jews were transported from Warsaw to
      Treblinka. Later in May of 1943, the entire population of the Warsaw
      ghetto was liquidated and most of them were transported to Treblinka. By
      July 11,1945, when the Soviet troops entered Warsaw, more than 700,000
      Jews were murdered at Treblinka. In 1967, Franz Stangl was arrested in
      Brazil . In December, 1970, he was sentenced to life in prison for his
      part in the murder of 400,000 people. He died in the prison the following
      June.</td>

      miles north of the major city of Lvov, conveniently between the large
      Jewish populations of south east Poland and eastern Galicia. The commander
      was Christian Wirth. They used the fixed gas chamber with gas produced by
      the internal-combustion engine of a motorcar. A report by a German officer
      describes how Jews rounded up in their villages were packed 200 to each
      cattle car. The journey to the Belzec death camp sometimes took more than
      a day without food or water. Jews constantly tried to break out walls and
      ceilings of the cars. Many succeeded but were shot by the soldiers
      guarding the cars. Jews were told before being assigned to labor duties
      they would be showered and disinfected. Men were separated from women and
      children and were marched off to large huts and were forced to undress. Women's
      hair was shaven off. They were then brutally pushed into the
      &quot;tube&quot; and into the gas chambers disguised as
      &quot;showers.&quot; The process of killing took about 30 minutes. Men,
      women, and children filing past in ghastly parade as a burly SS man
      promised in a loud voice that nothing terrible was going to happen to
      them. &quot;All you have to do is breathe in deeply. That strengthens the
      lungs. Inhaling is a means of preventing infection diseases. It's a good
      method of disinfections.&quot; To those who as their fate, the SS men gave
      them more reassurance. Edward Luczynski from a 1964 trial of German
      officers. &quot;After the doors were opened, it was often that some people
      were still alive. Children were on the floor and adults with their faces
      against the cracks sometimes managed to survive. The survivors were
      killed.&quot; Jewish workers removed gold teeth from bodies. Only a
      handful of survivors from Belzec. Probably a dozen thousand of Gypsies
      were murdered. Around 1943 the camp was closed. Locals looked for valuables
      but were driven off by guards. To keep them away, a German SS man made a
      farm out of it. </td>
