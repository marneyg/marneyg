      the mountain so their two strongest men went back to help those who fell
      behind or be left behind. On the third day we came to the village of Mohgarri.

      II was coming to an end and the Germans were trying to kill a many
      Holocaust victims as possible. They put children that were still alive in
      to the crematorium he remembers and always will remember the kids
      screaming and yelling. Solomon knows not stopping the German's from doing
      this was wrong But he wants every one to know that ''Please don't hate me
      because I had to do what ever it to make it through another day so I'm
      sorry''. The next survivor of the Holocaust is Joseph Sher who would also
      like to show you how he gave all his respect to a group of 20 or so Jews.
      As the end of the World War II finally came Joseph was out digging in his
      back yard when he found a hole filled with about 50 Jewish bodies quickly
      Joseph ran to the local police station where he reported it. Later as the
      police told Mr. Sher that the hole consisted of Jews from the time of the
      Holocaust. While he listened to this horrible news Joseph knew it was his
      duty to give these bodies a quite place to be. Joseph spent most of his
      life savings buying many Grave sites.

      it was the worst torture of medical science a person could even imagine
      eye ball laid every where under tables, on tables, and just plain every
      part of the room.He even witnessed one of his friends put in to a huge
      thing filled with ice cubes and water he froze to death but they made him
      wait it out instead of just simply killing him. Day after day a Luftwaffe
      doctor injected Simon's gentiles with poison and while going through that
      process he was fed buck wheat to keep him strong for testing. They
      treated every one like they were guinea pigs it was horrible and simply
      wrong. Later as a truck arrived to take the ones who were strong enough to
      work a lady who worked with Mengele took Simon and put her on that truck
      (even though he really wasn't strong enough). They were sent out to mine
      coal with their bare hands and next Simon worked on a construction project
      in Javozno for the Bayer division of I.G. Farben.</font></td>

      would all son be over. &quot; I will never forget when America's 7th Army

      what was happening ?'' As he went out for a walk he saw the burning of not
      just his synagogues but those of many. When he returned home to destroyed
      disaster all the clothes had been scented with a horrid smell that he
      can't ever forget. Margulies doesn't remember to much but he recalls his
      mother coming to school to get him so they could go in to hiding. While
      walking home from the school he saw his Torah burned down to almost
      nothing. Margulies cried as he asked his mother if God had died?</font></td>
