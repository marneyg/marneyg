      think of Anne Frank when thinking of the Holocaust.&nbsp; Though Anne
      didn't survive the Holocaust, her diary did.&nbsp; You might say that in a
      way she survived, because her diary discussed everything that she went
      through.&nbsp; Anne went through a lot during her short
      lifetime.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Anne was the second and youngest daughter of the Franks'.&nbsp; Her older
      sister was Margot.&nbsp; During Edith Frank's lifetime they never had

      Socialist Party led by Hitler did also.&nbsp; After that, Hitler made life
      for the Jews extremely difficult and almost unbearable.&nbsp; He did this
      because he believed the Jews were responsible for losing WWI.&nbsp; He
      also said that they exploited the horrible economic situation to their
      advantage.&nbsp; The Franks thought there would be no future for
      themselves in Germany.&nbsp; So, after this had started Otto Frank decided
      that they would be moving to Amsterdam in 1933 because of the Nazis.&nbsp;
      Otto Frank went there first and then the rest of them followed him
      later.&nbsp; Since, Anne was at a young age she could barely remember her
      old house, so she soon adjusted to the changes.&nbsp;

      a letter on July 5,1942, stating that she would be needing to report to a
      &quot;labor camp.&quot;&nbsp; Knowing that Margot was in trouble, they
      went into hiding the next day on July 6,1942.&nbsp; They moved into what
      they called the &quot;Secret Annexe&quot;, it was concealed behind a
      movable bookcase.&nbsp; This place was located at 263 Prisengracht.&nbsp;
      Anne found it fun and exciting at first.&nbsp; Later though, she found out
      different because it became very boring.&nbsp; The Franks weren't the only ones in hiding
      though,&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan, Peter, and Mr. Dussel joined them, so
      the place got even smaller.

    <td width="100%">While, in the Annexe they were not to make a move or make
      any noises between 8:30AM to 6:30PM.&nbsp; They did this to resist their fear of someone hearing them.&nbsp;
      Yet, they were always in constant fear
      because of&nbsp; the sounds and noises.&nbsp; Sitting there listening to
      the bombs exploding and shaking the building, hearing sirens that were
      taking&nbsp; there friends and family away as the war raged on.&nbsp; They
      also could hear gunfire and air raids.&nbsp; All of this affected Anne, so
      she would crawl into her father's bed, shaking with nerves and trying to
      find protection from the sounds and noises.&nbsp; While&nbsp; in hiding,
      they only had a messy, torn-up tin tub to bathe in.&nbsp; Anne described
      her life then on July 15, 1944: &quot;It is utterly impossible for me to
      build my foundation of chaos, suffering and death. I see the world being
      transformed into a wilderness, I feel the suffering of millions.&nbsp; And
      yet, when I look up at the sky, I some how feel that everything will
      change for the better, that this cruelty too shall end, that peace and
      tranquility will return once more.&quot;&nbsp; Even though they were in
      hiding they still had to keep up with their reading, studies, and other
      schoolwork.&nbsp; All though they mainly were bored and scared, that is
      not all they did, they had fun playing! For fun they would tell jokes and
      riddles, and sometimes they liked reviewing books they read. Trying to
      keep fit required them doing a form of exercise called calisthenics.&nbsp;
      Calisthenics is an exercise that you can do in a small area, which helps
      build muscle and stay fit.&nbsp; Anne described this as: &quot;One day
      we're laughing at the comical side of life in hiding, and the next day
      we're frightened, and the fear, tension, and despair can be read on our
      faces...Let something happen soon, even an air raid.&nbsp; Nothing can be
      more crushing than anxiety.&quot;&nbsp; They never set a foot outside
      while being in hiding.&nbsp; They were in hiding for 25 months and then
      the Gestapo found them.
