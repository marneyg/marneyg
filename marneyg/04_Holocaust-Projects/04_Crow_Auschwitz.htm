    <td width="50%">On May 27,1940 a concentration camp (Auschwitz) was
      established on the outskirts of Oswiecim on the order of Heinrich Himmler.
      It was made to hold 10,000 inmates. Himmler visited Auschwitz in March 1941
      and commanded its enlargement to hold 30,000 prisoners. He also ordered
      construction of a second camp for 100,000 inmates. After March 1942 the SS
      developed a gigantic extermination complex at Birkenau which included
      so-called bathing arrangements. In reality these were nothing else but
      disguised shower heads used for the gassing of prisoners with the intent
      to cause death using Zyclon-B pellets. Auschwitz II was an extensive
      complex made up of wooden structures which were originally built to stable
      fifty-two horses. During World War II Nazi's murdered more than one
      million people in the camp. At this time it was the world's largest
      collective grave. In 1942, the most massive murder campaign in history
      began in Auschwitz when Nazi's put in operation a plan to destroy the
      entire Jewish population of Europe.&nbsp;</td>

      camp conditions. Some of them were outright killed. The first transport of
      prisoners arrived June 1940 and the SS administration and staff was
      established. On March 1, 1941, the camp population was 10,900. The camp
      quickly developed a reputation for torture and mass shootings. May 1940,
      Pole's were evicted from the vicinity of the barracks (most of them were
      executed). 300 Jews from the large Jewish community of Oswiecim were
      pressed into service. In February 1943, a section for Gypsies was
      established at Auschwitz II. In September 1943 an area was reserved for
      Czech Jews deported from Theresienstad, so-called &quot;Family Camp&quot;.
      Gas chambers and crematorium's were opened in March.</td>

      spot. Josef Mengele (camp doctor) would torture and inflect incredible
      suffering on the Jewish children. &quot;Patients&quot; were put into
      pressure chambers, tested with drugs, castrated, frozen to death, and
      exposed to other traumas. Likewise at Auschwitz, Clauberg's colleague, Dr,
      Herta Oberauser, killed children with oil and evipan injections, removed
      their limbs and vital organs, and rubbed ground glass and sawdust into his
      patients wounds. A case in which the mother does not want to leave her
      child Josef Mengal would draw his gun and shoot both the mother and her
      child. Near the end of the war, in order to cut expenses and to save gas,
      they would order to put children directly into ovens or throw them in open
      burning pits. </td>

      The camp had 4 crematorium's with gas chambers. The SS also used fire pits
      and funeral piles to burn bodies. When in operation, the crematorium's at
      Auschwitz had a capacity for incinerating 350 bodies per day (2-3 bodies
      in each). The crematorium's were used to ultimately&nbsp; dispose of the
      bodies. All this was, was to satisfy Hitlers demand for a final solution
      to the Jewish question. At the end of the war, in an effort to remove all
      traces of crimes they committed, the SS began dismantling and raising gas
      chambers, crematorium's, and as well as burning documents.&nbsp; </td>
